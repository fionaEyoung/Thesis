\section{Components of final value}

The tract atlases and FOD data contain both spatial and directional information, all of which contribute to the final inner product value.
It is worth investigating, however, to what extent those two factors influence the final result.
It is conceivable for example that the final map value is predominantly determined by the overall amplitude of one or both of the ODFs, with the non-zeroth SH coefficients having little additional effect.
