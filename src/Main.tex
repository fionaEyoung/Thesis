% UCL Thesis LaTeX Template
%  (c) Ian Kirker, 2014
%
% This is a template/skeleton for PhD/MPhil/MRes theses.
%
% It uses a rather split-up file structure because this tends to
%  work well for large, complex documents.
% We suggest using one file per chapter, but you may wish to use more
%  or fewer separate files than that.
% We've also separated out various bits of configuration into their
%  own files, to keep everything neat.
% Note that the \input command just streams in whatever file you give
%  it, while the \include command adds a page break, and does some
%  extra organisation to make compilation faster. Note that you can't
%  use \include inside an \include-d file.
% We suggest using \input for settings and configuration files that
%  you always want to use, and \include for each section of content.
% If you do that, it also means you can use the \includeonly statement
%  to only compile up the section you're currently interested in.
% You might also want to put figures into their own files to be \input.

% For more information on \input and \include, see:
%  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include


% Formatting and binding rules for theses are here:
%  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/format-bind-and-submit-your-thesis-general-guidance

% This package goes first and foremost, because it checks all
%  your syntax for mistakes and some old-fashioned LaTeX commands.
% Note that normally you should load your documentclass before
%  packages, because some packages change behaviour based on
%  your document settings.
% Also, for those confused by the RequirePackage here vs usepackage
%  elsewhere, usepackage cannot be used before the documentclass
%  command, while RequirePackage can. That's the only functional
%  difference as far as I'm aware.
\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}


% ------ Main document class specification ------
% The draft option here prevents images being inserted,
%  and adds chunky black bars to boxes that are exceeding
%  the page width (to show that they are).
% The oneside option can optionally be replaced by twoside if
%  you intend to print double-sided. Note that this is
%  *specifically permitted* by the UCL thesis formatting
%  guidelines.

\interfootnotelinepenalty10000

% Sets up links within your document, for e.g. contents page entries
%  and references, and also PDF metadata.
% You should edit this!
\input{setup/LinksAndMetadata}

% And then some settings in separate files.
\input{setup/FloatSettings} % For things like figures and tables
\input{setup/BibSettings}   % For bibliographies
\input{setup/AcronymsAndGlossary}
\input{setup/Epigraphs}

% These control how many number sections your subsections will take
%    e.g. Section 2.3.1.5.6.3
%  and how many of those will get put into the contents pages.

% \nobibliography*
% ^-- This is a dumb trick that works with the bibentry package to let
%  you put bibliography entries whereever you like.
% I used this to put references to papers a chapter's work was
%  published in at the end of that chapter.
