\section{Validation}

\note{How the method was validated. This is all the Tractoinferno / HCP data stuff, plus maybe qualitative results?}
\note{Also discussion about lack of ground truth data and different validation metrics.}

\subsection{Comparison with benchmark methods}

\note{Largescale validation in HCP and tractoinferno datasets, comparing to reference tractography and TractSeg}

\subsubsection{TractSeg atlas}

\note{Direct comparison with TractSeg using their training data to create atlases}
