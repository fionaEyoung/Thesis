\section{Clinical validation}

\note{need different section title}

\note{More qualitative validation in as many sample datasets as possible, including intraoperative data, tumour deformation and debulking cases. Show specific cases where differs from e.g. tractography or TractSeg in specific areas like peritumoural oedema. Also analyse failure cases.}

\note{Would be nice to also have e.g. epilepsy cases in here?}
