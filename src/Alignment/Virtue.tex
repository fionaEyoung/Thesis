\section{Tumour deformation modelling}
\label{chapterlabel3}

\note{This is where the tumour model is described. There will be maths!}

\note{There will be stuff about the forward and reverse models, the different options for $k$ (linear, exponential etc.)}

\note{Maybe also some speculative stuff about infiltration}
