\chapter{Aligning Atlas and data}\label{chap:reg}

\note{This chapter is about bringing the atlas into alignment with the data. This could be simple registration, as in the healthy cases, non-linear registration or registration combined with tumour deformation modelling.}

\section{Registration}

\note{Cover all the registration options (there aren't many). Maybe discuss T1+FA registration}
