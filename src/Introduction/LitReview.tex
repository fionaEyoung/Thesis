\section{Review of Literature}
\label{review}

\note{This section is more about the specific background of this project; the methodolgy and clinical practice.}


\subsection{Diffusion MRI analysis}
%==================================

\note{All the computational methodological stuff}

\subsubsection{Diffusion MRI as a white matter imaging tool}

\note{I guess an overview? The usual ``it's all we've got!" litany}

\subsubsection{Fiber orientation modelling}

\note{The goal of getting the fibre orientations from raw diffusion data, and how we get there.
Cover DTI, crossing fibres, compartment models and CSD}

\subsubsection{Streamline tractography}

\note{Discuss as the mainstay of white matter bundle segmentation.
Cover fundamentals (including what it isn't), det/prop, different fibre models, virtual dissection, the usual suspects}

\subsubsection{White matter segmentation}

\note{Potentially a better section title? For covering direct segmentation, atlas methods and deep learning}


\subsection{Neurosurgery}
%========================

\subsubsection{Indications for neurosurgery}

\note{This is for all the reasons for surgery, including tumour, epilepsy DBS.
Also more detail into the types of tumours, and locations in the brain}

\subsubsection{Lesion resection}

\note{Focus on tumours, but could also be epilepsy resections.
Cover extent of resection (measurement, definitions etc.), biopsy, relationship between EOR and outcomes}

\subsubsection{Surgical neuronavigation}

\note{All the various tools and gizmos for guided surgery. Split into preoperative planning and intraoperative use.
Include functional imaging (EEG, fMRI, EEG), structural, tractography, DES, awake surgery/monitoring and intraoperative imaging.}
