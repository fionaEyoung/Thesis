\chapter{Review of Literature}
\label{review}

Having given a brief introduction to the principles neuroanatomy and \gls{dmri} physics and image formation, we will turn now to the modern developments in applying \gls{dmri} to qualitative and quantitative analysis of \gls{wm} organisation.
This chapter will take us through early to state-of-the art uses of \gls{dmri} as a \gls{wm} imaging tool and outstanding challenges, followed by a review of key relevant concepts in neurosurgery.

\section{Diffusion MRI analysis}
%==================================

Though the tools for studying the structure and function of neural connectivity are numerous, \gls{dmri} remains the only available technique capable of investigating microscopic \gls{wm} structure of the entire human brain \textit{in vivo}.
% This is thanks to the \note{fibrous} organisation of \gls{wm} fibres, which group together in bundles forming a restrictive diffusion environment in which axon membranes and myelin sheaths form barriers to diffusing water molecules.
% The resulting anisotropic diffusion pattern, with preferential diffusion along the axon direction, forms the basis for \gls{dmri}-based \gls{wm} analysis.
Though the mechanism of diffusion weighted signal is well understood (see section \ref{sec:dmri}), its correct interpretation hinges on an understanding of how diffusion is affected by the microstructural environment\autocite{LeBihan1995}, or even by just those features of the microstructural environment we are interested in measuring.
It is not obvious, for example, how much of diffusion within a voxel filled with myelinated axons can be best characterised as either hindered or restricted, and how properties such as axon density and diameter might contribute to the observed signal.\autocite{Panagiotaki2012}

\note{moving on, cite: Alexander2019...}
The journey from raw \gls{dmri} data to meaningful representations of \gls{wm} microstructure is far from direct.
\Gls{dmri} image \glspl{voxel} are on the order of cubic millimetres, and in such a volume are contained thousands of individual axons and cells.\note{cite}
What's more, rarely are all axons within a voxel uniformly aligned with a single direction.
Throughout the brain, fibre tracts mingle and intersect, bend and fan out.\autocite{Jeurissen2013,Alexander2019}
The physical diffusion processes in such complex configurations and multicellular environments cannot be known, only approximated and modelled through a choice of assumptions and simplifications.
In this there are, of course, many contrasting approaches, developed for different applications and the directed study of specific quantities and microstructural features.
Such target properties of \gls{dmri} analysis include cellular composition of \gls{gm}, axon density and myelination, intra- and extracellular water content, and diffusivity perpendicular to axonal orientation.
Collectively, these scalar parameters are fit from a family of microstructural models known collectively as multi-compartment models, so named for their separation of the measured signal into isolated compartments representing, for example, intra-axonal or extracellular space, each with different diffusion patterns.\autocite{Panagiotaki2012,Alexander2019}
These parameters could capture virtual cytohistological information and even serve as biomarkers for disease.\note{cite}
For the purposes of studying macroscopic brain connectivity and the course and organisation of individual \gls{wm} fibre tracts, the key information of interest to be determined from raw \gls{dmri} is the distribution of axonal orientations within each voxel described by a \gls{fod}.

\subsection{Tissus microstructure  and fibre orientation modelling}

The first approach for modelling fibre orientations came in the form of \gls{dti}, which remains one of the dominant diffusion models in many applications today, particularly in clinical contexts.
The diffusion process within a \gls{wm} voxel is modelled as a three dimensional gaussian distribution, whose covariance matrix is proportional to the diffusion tensor\autocite{Basser1994,ODonnell2011} in equation (\ref{eq:dt}).
By diagonalising this matrix, which is symmetric and positive-definite, three orthogonal eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geqslant \lambda_2 \geqslant \lambda_3$ can be computed.
Rotationally invariant indices including mean diffusivity \gls{fa} provide scalar quantities which can be interpreted in terms of underlying tissue properties, the latter being given by \note{fucking what exactly??}

The principle eigenvector $\bm{\lambda}_1$ is usually interpreted as the direction of fastest, or least restricted, diffusivity, although this holds only in voxels with a single population of straight, parallel axons.
If the diffusion tensor, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be represented in the form of a zeppelin shaped surface of equal mean displacement, is used as a rudimentary approximation of the \gls{fod}, then $\bm{\lambda}_1$ is taken as the single peak orientation of axon fibres.
In fact, it is rare for a voxel of \gls{wm} to contain only a single uniformly oriented bundle of axons.
In so-called crossing fibre voxels, where at least two distinctly oriented fibre populations reside, the diffusion tensor provides a woefully inaccurate or misleading picture: a smaller population with a low signal contribution may be entirely unrepresented in the modelled \gls{odf} peak, or else the effect is one of averaging all contributing populations such that none of the actual underlying fibre directions are indicated by the \gls{dt} eigenvectors.

The crossing fibres problem led to \gls{dti}, at least in research imaging, gradually giving way to higher-order fibre orientation modelling techniques which aim to account for more than one, or even an arbitrary number of distinctly oriented fibre populations\autocite{Alexander2005}.
These include to an extent the multi-compartment models which can include multiple directional intra-axonal compartments, such as the popular ``ball and sticks" model\autocite{Behrens2003,Behrens2007}.
Alternatively, several approaches aim to retrieve an underlying orientation distribution with arbitrary number of peaks through transforming the raw signal \gls{odf} into a spherical distribution of diffusivity or correlates thereof.
Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI)\autocite{Wedeen2008}, and the less data-demanding Q-ball imaging\autocite{Tuch2003,Tuch2004}, are examples of methods that reconstruct a distribution of water molecule displacement (\gls{dodf}), with peaks aligned with the (presumed) fibre orientation.
Deconvolution methods begin with the premise that a single population of parallel fibres will produce a characteristic \gls{dmri} signal profile.
Then, the observed signal $S(\theta,\phi)$ in a given voxel amounts to a convolution over the fibre orientation distribution function $F(\theta,\phi)$ with this single fibre ``response" kernel $R(\theta)$:
\begin{align}
  S(\theta,\phi) = F(\theta,\phi) \otimes R(\theta)
\end{align}\label{eq:csd}
Solving (\ref{eq:csd}) for $F(\theta,\phi)$, represented in spherical harmonics basis as given by (\ref{eq:shfun}), involves computing the inverse operation: A spherical \textit{de}convolution of the signal with the response function.
Early versions of this concept included \textcite{Anderson2005}, in which the response kernel was modelled as a diffusion tensor.
In another approach presented by \textcite{Tournier2004} $R(\theta)$ is estimated directly from the data, generally by averaging the signals from voxels with the highest diffusion anisotropy, and thus does not rely on a model of diffusion, although it does rely on the assumption that a single fibre population's response is uniform throughout the brain and for different fibre configurations.
To improve angular resolution and reduce noise sensitivity in the estimated \gls{fod}, a regularised implementation in which biophysically impossible negative $F(\theta,\phi)$ values are strongly penalised gave rise to the widely used \gls{csd} method.
\Gls{csd} can reconstruct \glspl{fod} resolving multiple crossing fibre populations with high angular resolution in a matter of seconds, from \gls{dmri} datasets with acquisition parameters achievable in routine imaging practice\autocite{Tournier2013}.
In addition to providing a means for estimating the \gls{fod} to a high degree of angular resolution, \gls{csd} also spurred exploration of new quantities relating to tissue microstructure, notably the interpretation of the \gls{fod} amplitude as measure of intra-axonal volume fraction, or \gls{afd} \autocite{Raffelt2012a}.
\Gls{afd} can be defined as a directional quantity or as a single scalar per voxel, obtained by integrating $F$ over the sphere.

By design, \gls{csd} presumes that the entire signal in a voxel can be explained by contributions from a number of fibre populations, each forming a highly restrictive environment in which diffusion is anisotropic.
Within pure and highly organised \gls{wm}, this is a reasonable assumption, however limitations become apparent outside of these areas.
As we have seen in previous sections, brain tissue covers a spectrum of cytoarchitectures and a corresponding diversity in diffusion environments.
At the typical resolutions of \gls{dmri} data, voxels may contain, in addition to axon fibres, signal contributions from \gls{csf} or \gls{gm}, which are typically characterised by isotropic and freer diffusion.
The result of such partial volume effects are highly noisy \gls{fod} estimates with spurious peaks, overestimation of \gls{fod} peak amplitudes and overestimation of \gls{afd} in affected voxels.\autocite{Jeurissen2014}
In addition, the original \gls{csd} method was designed only for data acquired with a single diffusion weighting $b$ factor (``shell"), unable to take advantage of the additional information contained in more advanced and increasingly popular multi-shell acquisitions.
To address these limitations, an extension proposed in \textcite{Jeurissen2014} and referred to as \gls{msmt} \gls{csd} includes support for multiple $b$-value shells and separation of the signal into contributions from different tissue compartments, typically \gls{wm}, \gls{gm}, and \gls{csf}, each with their own characteristic response functions.
The resulting \gls{fod} estimates have higher angular precision than \gls{ssst} \gls{csd}, with fewer noisy spurious lobes to confound downstream processing and interpretation.
Furthermore, separation of the isotropic signal contributions greatly improves the interpretation of \gls{fod} amplitude as a measure of \gls{afd}, as the amplitudes of each tissue's deconvolved \gls{odf} closely correspond to their respective tissue volume fractions\autocite{Jeurissen2014}.

\subsection{Streamline tractography}

% \note{Discuss as the mainstay of white matter bundle segmentation.
% Cover fundamentals (including what it isn't), det/prop, different fibre models, virtual dissection, the usual suspects}

Up to this point, we have only discussed the processing and analysis of \gls{dmri} data, and what it can or cannot reveal about \gls{wm} microstructure, at the level of individual image \glspl{voxel}.
However, the individual axons that form fibre tracts can traverse 100s of millimetres, and with the unique ability to measure fibre orientations in each voxel it wasn't long before this information was being exploited to reconstruct axonal connections in their entirety.
The basic principle is one of treating fibre orientations as a brain-wide vector field through which the paths of virtual neural fibres can be traced in a process called streamline tractography.
It is vital to note here that the paths of individual \textit{in vivo} axons are entirely indiscernible from \gls{dmri}.
The individual streamlines of tractography are entirely abstract mathematical objects, each a collection of vertices, which aim to capture the \textit{potential} pathways of axons consistent with the observed \glspl{fod} representing an ensemble of thousands of axons.
Tractography is an immensely powerful and useful tool, and at the same time full of flaws due to this abstract and indirect nature.
All tractography algorithms consist at their core of the following steps:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, frame=single]
streamlines = []
while length(streamlines) < N do
  streamline = [get_seed_vertex()]
  STOP = false;
  while not STOP
    vertex = streamline[end]
    v = get_local_direction(vertex)
    new_vertex = vertex + step_size*v
    append(streamline, new_vertex)
    STOP = evaluate_stop(new_vertex)
  append(streamlines, streamline)
\end{lstlisting}

Within this simple algorithm are a plethora of parameters and decisions which which have transformative effects on the result.
They are apparent in the undefined functions such as \verb|get_local_direction()| or \verb|get_seed_vertex()| and the scalar parameters \verb|step_size| and \verb|N|.
The seed location, step length, conditions for terminating or entirely rejecting streamlines, interpolation of the surrounding vector field, number of streamlines to generate, are all choices to be made by the user (although in practice many parameters will be automatically determined or set to default values by the chosen algorithm).
There are two choices that most fundamentally affect the tractography process and which feature most heavily in discussions on its use.

First is the choice of method for representing orientation information from the underlying data.
The earliest tractography algorithms were developed almost concurrently with \gls{dti}\autocite{Mori1998,Mori1999}, with the orientation vector field constructed from the principle eigenvectors of fitted diffusion tensors.
In the \gls{fact} algorithm proposed by \textcite{Mori1999}, the local direction for each vertex is assigned from $\bm{\lambda}_1$ of the current voxel, and the stop criterion is a measure of neighbourhood fibre collinearity falling below a predefined threshold.
With only a single possible propagation direction at each location, which, as discussed above, may throughout much of the brain have little to do with any true axon orientations at that point, diffusion tensor-based tractography can only track fibre pathways with rather limited accuracy.
Streamlines may continue happily along a physiologically plausible path until encountering a region of intersecting tracts, at which point it may be prematurely terminated or diverted onto the trajectory of this intersecting tract if a continuation of the current path is entirely unsupported by the principle eigenvector field.

It becomes clear when considering what we learned about neural connections in section \ref{sec:hodology}, about compact fibre bundles diverging to distributed cortical targets, that a single dominant fibre direction at every point is incompatible with the dynamic organisation of \gls{wm} tracts, and the result is a tendency to reconstruct narrow and incomplete fibre bundles\autocite{Farquharson2013}.
A well cited example of this limitation can be seen in reconstructions of the \gls{cst}, known to emanate from the entire motor cortex from the apex down to the Sylvian fissure, but which in renderings by \gls{dt}-based algorithm appears as little more than a \note{?????}.
Against this background, tractography based on higher-order fibre orientation models represents a vast improvement in the ability to contend with tracking in the complex configurations of \gls{wm}.
Now when two perpendicular tracts occupy the same voxel, the possible tracking direction is not limited to either that of the dominant bundle such that tracking the smaller one is impossible, or of an average of the two such that neither is properly represented.
With multi-peak distributions, each distinct fibre orientation is \note{??}
However, with this flexibility comes ambiguity, as when there are multiple distinct possible directions in which to propagate the streamline at any position, the decision of which direction to take becomes far more complex.
While tensor-based tractography may be particularly prone to false negatives, or neglecting certain pathways, multi-peak tractography can easily produce false-positives by hopping onto the paths of intersecting tracts.

The second significant distinction is between deterministic and probabilistic tracking approaches.
In deterministic tractography, there is only one single direction in which a streamline can be propagated from any given point, and two streamlines seeded in exactly the same location will be identical.
But the certainty implied by this deterministic approach is at significant odds with the reality that tractography operates in a domain and resolution far removed from that of individual axons.
Probabilistic tractography algorithms are here to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent in the tracking process.
Numerous probabilistic tracking algorithms have been developed, and while the end effect is essentially the same, whereby the next step direction is sampled from a probability distribution instead of deterministically selected, and seeding in the exact same location will not give rise to identical streamlines, there are two subtly different schools in what sort of uncertainty is being considered\autocite{Jeurissen2019}.
One considers the \textit{measurement} uncertainty of the calculated orientations.
Under this approach, the general direction to take is not under question, but the accuracy of that direction is.
It holds that due to noise and inherent limitations in our measurement equipment and signal modelling, the fibre orientations can only be calculated with limited accuracy, and the tracking directions are sampled from a distribution reflecting this measurement uncertainty.
The probabilistic algorithm probtrackx\autocite{Behrens2007}, based on the ball-and-sticks fibre orientation model\autocite{Behrens2003}, is a notable example of this approach.

A second school takes the view that uncertainty surrounding selecting a streamline step direction \note{??} stems from the obscurity of the underlying physiological reality, and sampling that direction from the fibre \gls{odf} reflects that microstructural complexity.
Crucially though, tracking is not proceeding under any guidance relating to real biophysical connections, and though a streamline's direction in a given voxel may well be in accordance with real axons, whether that direction is appropriate in the context of the preceding steps of the same streamline is unresolvable.
In other words, \gls{fod}-based probabilistic tractography, of which first or second-order integration over FODs (iFOD1/iFOD2)\autocite{Tournier2012,Tournier2010} are notable examples, can capture the local dispersion of fibres in high detail, but that doesn't necessarily translate to long-range accuracy.
It is possible to constrain tractography according to broad heuristics about fibre tract geometries, but inevitably such simplifications will not be globally applicable.
For example, strategies to prevent streamlines from ``hopping" onto intersecting, but not physically connected, pathways can include placing upper limits on the angle between successive steps under the expectation that most tracts will carry more or less straight on, but there are plenty of tracts in the brain with regions of high curvature, which become much harder to accurately reconstruct if the ``straight ahead" constraint is too strict.

Due to streamline tractography's locally oriented and step-by-step nature, errors and missteps accumulate rapidly with little to no opportunity to correct them, resulting in some wildly implausible streamlines.
Attempts to address this blindness to biophysical reality are at the focus of much of modern tractography research\autocite{Bastiani2017,Rheault2019,Aydogan2021}, as the consequences of these ongoing challenges to connectivity research and neurology are substantial\autocite{Schilling2019, Yang2021, Grisot2021}.

\subsection{White matter segmentation}

The functional division of white matter into distinct tracts is of great consequence to neuroscience, psychology and neurology in their efforts to analyse brain structure and function, and aligns we will see later, identifying tracts is also of vital importance in neurosurgery.
It follows that the spatial delineation of individual tracts is a key step in many \gls{dmri} analysis pipelines.

Streamline tractography was the first, and remains the dominant answer to this task.
Though the field is wide and the specific approaches numerous, we will outline the two main frameworks through which individual tract segmentations are derived using streamline tractography.
The first, sometimes dubbed ``virtual fibre dissection", involves generating a large number (on the order of 10s of millions) of streamlines, usually covering the entire brain, followed by a selection process whereby streamlines are assigned to a tract of interest or discarded.
Streamline tracking proceeds virtually uninhibited, terminating only if a maximum length is reached or when leaving the white matter (as indicated by tissue segmentations\autocite{Smith2012} or a \gls{fod} amplitude threshold).
After tracking, one approach for selecting streamlines belonging to the target bundle is to use logical \glspl{roi}, specifying inclusion volumes which must be visited and exclusion volumes which filter unwanted tracks.
These selection and exclusion \glspl{roi} encapsulating our \textit{a priori} neuroanatomical knowledge, and the resulting bundle, comprising only those streamlines fulfilling the criteria, represents the segmented tract.
The streamlines may be viewed as three-dimensional objects, or further processed into volumetric streamline density maps\autocite{Calamante2010} and thresholded binary segmentations.

Alternatives to \gls{roi}-based selection are clustering methods, which classify streamlines according to their proximity or similarity to each other.
RecoBundles\autocite{Garyfallidis2018}, White Matter Analysis \autocite{ODonnell2017, ODonnell2007}, atlas based adaptive clustering \autocite{Tunc2014}, and example-based automatic tract labelling \autocite{Yoo2015} are all examples of data driven, group-wise streamline clustering and matching approaches.
They typically rely on example data or streamline atlases based on which similar streamlines are recognised in the target data and labelled accordingly.
Another approach, named Classifyber, uses a learned linear classification of streamline features to label streamlines belonging to the target bundle in a new subject \autocite{Berto2021}.
In all clustering approaches, the necessary generation of whole brain tractograms and the additional construction of example or reference tractography data present barriers to application, as well as, in some cases, long processing times and high memory requirements\autocite{Wasserthal2018}.

The whole brain approach is computationally extremely wasteful, as the vast number of streamlines generated will not even represent \textit{any} anatomically valid pathway through the brain, let alone one belonging to the tract of interest.
Furthermore, if streamlines are randomly seeded throughout the brain, then longer tracts covering a larger volume are more likely to be sampled, the tendency to continue straight along a ``path of least resistance" at diverging or crossing fibres results in inordinate overrepresentation of certain pathways\autocite{Smith2013}.
All this means that, after perhaps hours of tracking and billions of streamlines created, only a handful may be included in a final bundle reconstruction.

The second approach may be called ``targeted tractography", an involves only seeding streamlines in a tract-specific \gls{roi} and retaining those that fulfil tract-specific selection criteria, provided as additional inclusion and exclusion regions, until a target number of streamlines have been selected.
A seed region can but does not necessarily have to be placed at one of the actual anatomical ends of the tract, and in some cases it makes more sense to seed from the middle of the tract and propagate bidirectionally, placing additional include regions at the ends to ensure complete coverage.
This approach does not mean that no streamlines are discarded (seeded fibres may be terminated before fulfilling all inclusion criteria, or stray into exclusion regions) but targeted seeding and selection certainly leads to a higher number of admissible streamlines being generated in far less computational time than in the whole brain approach, while discarding unwanted streamlines on the fly reduces storage requirements.
Targeted tractography is the more common approach particularly in applications where only a few or even just a single tract are relevant, such as in neurosurgery\autocite{Yang2021}.

Manual placement of \glspl{roi} in both whole-brain and targeted pipelines represents a significant intellectual burden, relies on expert anatomical knowledge and can be extremely time consuming, so it is often automated by registering atlases, as in TractQuerier\autocite{Wassermann2016} or Tracula \autocite{Yendiki2011}, or pre-defined \glspl{roi}, as in XTRACT \autocite{Warrington2020}.
The former two are examples of methods that rely on comprehensive cortical parcellations, typically obtained with a software tool such as FreeSurfer which can take many hours to run.
In many scenarios, manual \gls{roi} placement remains the default method, particularly in clinical contexts where automatic \gls{roi} registration or segmentation may fail due to pathology.
Here, not only is a good understanding of the anatomy of a tract is vital to produce high quality reconstructions, but the user will also need to understand the biases and pitfalls of their chosen \gls{fod} model and tractography algorithm to ensure proper interpretation and qualification of the results\autocite{Rheault2020,Rheault2022}.
Even to an experienced user, producing quality bundles is often time-consuming and tedious.
While modern research applications and increasingly more clinical applications almost exclusively favour probabilistic and multi-fibre \gls{odf} algorithms thanks to higher sensitivity to complex fibre configurations\autocite{Yang2021}, an inevitable trade-off is a high prevalence of false positive streamlines, representing either irrelevant or unphysical connections.
Filtering out these unwanted streamlines remains a considerable challenge\autocite{Jorgens2021}.
Attempts to reduce their creation in the first instance include injecting more anatomical priors into the tracking process, such as by modifying \glspl{fod} to favour the directions associated with the target tract\autocite{Rheault2019}, using directional \glspl{roi} for particularly tricky geometries \autocite{Chamberland2017}, or designing alternatives to the piece-wise linear tracking paradigm that aim to generate streamlines with more anatomical plausibility \autocite{Schomburg2017,Aydogan2021}.
Finally, due to a combination of the different computational methods available, and a general lack of consensus on the precise anatomical extents of many commonly reconstructed pathways, tractography suffers from notoriously low reproducibility\autocite{Schilling2021a}.

In view of these limitations, some in the field are continuing efforts to improve streamline tractography with novel tracking algorithms, finding new ways to incorporate anatomical priors and developing more powerful streamline filtering, clustering and selection strategies.
Others are looking towards white matter segmentation solutions that do not rely on tractography at the point of application, but instead produce voxel-wise tract segmentations directly from \gls{dmri} or \gls{fod} data.

\paragraph*{Streamline free white matter segmentation}

\note{copypasta from HBM manuscript}

A further set of prior works address the problem of tract segmentation while forgoing the use of streamline tractography entirely.
These include deep learning models for direct segmentation from fibre orientation representations (\textcite{Li2020, Wasserthal2018}), a multi-label supervised clustering approach (\textcite{Ratnarajah2014}) and level-set and front propagation situations (\textcite{Nazem-Zadeh2011, Hao2014}).
Deep learning-based approaches have the advantage of producing highly reproducible results in short processing time, without, in the case of TractSeg, the need for template registration.
However, drawbacks of direct, deep learning-based methods which produce binary segmentations include a lack of explainability, and a dependence on large volumes of annotated training data which are labour-intensive to produce.
This limits their flexibility: if a user requires a tract segmentation which is either anatomically different or not covered by an existing pre-trained model, then the necessary production of new training data and subsequent model training represents a high logistical and computational barrier.
There is also the question of robustness in clinical data, particularly those featuring gross structural pathologies such as tumours.
In addition to healthy data, Neuro4Neuro\textcite{Li2020} was validated only in a dementia dataset, and TractSeg\autocite{Wasserthal2018} was qualitatively validated in schizophrenia and autism datasets in the original work.
TractSeg has also been qualitatively validated in a tumour dataset with mostly successful results, with more complete segmentations in cases with minimally displacing tumours.\autocite{Richards2021}
In \textcite{Moshe2022}, the authors trained their own TractSeg model, on approximately 500 datasets, to segment the \gls{cst} in brain tumour patients.
The results were more reproducible than for the compared manual method, and obtained an average dice similarity score of 0.64, almost 25\% worse than the performance in healthy data reported in the original TractSeg study (for the same tract).
The authors cite a lack of reliable and sufficient labelled training data as a reason for limiting their study to a single tract, despite the importance of other tracts in preoperative fibre mapping.

Our aim is to develop a streamline free tract segmentation technique incorporating spatial and orientational priors, with a focus on computational simplicity, specificity, and intuitive output.
Briefly, the proposed method consists of a tract-specific orientation distribution atlas, which encodes spatial and orientational prior information about each tract, which is then directly compared with the diffusion data derived fibre orientation distribution information in the target image via an inner product operation on the two spherical distributions.
Here we report on extensive validation of our approach applied to the \gls{cst}, \gls{or} and \gls{af}.
Those three tracts were chosen due to their high clinical relevance and frequent involvement with surgical targets: In \textcite{Toescu2020} they were cited by neurosurgeons as the most frequently reconstructed tracts, followed by the \gls{ifof} and corpus callosum.
Generalisation to additional tracts is straightforward and requires relatively few training subjects, which is ideal in clinical translation, where appropriate data is often hard to obtain.
Preliminary results for this approach have been published in \textcite{Young2022}, where we focused on qualitative results in the context of neurosurgical subjects with significantly deforming tumours.
Here we provide a more detailed description of the technique as well as extensive quantitative validation of general applicability to both healthy and clinical datasets.

Our work bears much similarity of intuition and approach to that in \textcite{Bazin2011} (``Diffusion-Oriented Tract Segmentation", or DOTS), but with several practical differences.
DOTS is based on \gls{dt} modelling, with the atlas' direction prior consisting of a single principal direction per voxel, rather than a full spherical distribution as in our approach.
The comparison between the atlas and subject data to be segmented consists of several mathematical steps involving Markov random field models, neighbouring tensor connectivity, and propagation of probabilities, compared to our approach of taking the inner product of two spherical distributions.
The \gls{dt} atlas described in \textcite{Hagler2009} also proposes a similar concept.
There, a fibre location and orientation atlas is created by averaging the \gls{dt} and tractography-derived information from multiple subjects and subsequently used to estimate the voxel-wise \textit{a posteriori} tract probability in a single subject.
In contrast to our proposed atlas, orientation information was encoded by averaging \gls{dt} principal eigenvectors across subjects, instead of a tract-specific approach to orientation as in our case.
And in \textcite{Hagler2009}, spatial probability is given by the averaged, normalised track density values from individual deterministic streamline tractography, even though equating streamline density with likelihood of tract location is problematic.\autocite{Rheault2019,Smith2013}
Finally, there are similarities with the bundle specific tractography approach described in \textcite{Rheault2019}, in particular the use of a streamline-template and track orientation distribution (TOD) mapping,\autocite{Dhollander2014} and extension of track density imaging\autocite{Calamante2010} into the angular domain, to incorporate orientational priors.
However, the purpose of the TOD prior in that work was to enhance tractography, whereas our aim is to forgo tractography entirely at the point of application in a new subject.

%========================

\subsection{Indications for neurosurgery}

\note{This is for all the reasons for surgery, including tumour, epilepsy DBS.
Also more detail into the types of tumours, and locations in the brain}

Many types of interventions fall under the remit of neurosurgery.
\note{research most common procedures}
Common ones include inserting electrodes for \gls{dbs}, extraction of tissue biopsies, vascular surgeries, and placement of shunts.
All of these examples involve invasive procedures for which accurate neuronavigation is a vital component, and as such the following discussions on surgical planning and navigation pertain to them too.

This review will focus on the most complex and invasive types of neurosurgery: tissue resections, most commonly the removal of tumours and epileptogenic brain tissue. \note{includes biopsy?}
In particular, tumour resections involve a unique combination of complexities and a high degree of variability.
Indeed, it is sort of misleading to sweepingly refer to all neurosurgical procedures involving \note{cranial?supracellar?} \gls{cns} neoplasms as ``brain tumour resections", so diverse are those conditions in presentation, neurophysiology, microbiology, treatment plans, and prognosis.
Such diversity presents a significant barrier to the development of image processing methods intended for generalisation to use in tumour patients.
For example, tumours occur throughout the brain, and the location has an impact on the effects on surrounding brain structures.
Midline tumours can affect both hemispheres, while tumours far from the midline may enact no effects whatsoever on the contralateral hemisphere, in which case for image processing purposes, the contralateral hemisphere could be considered ``normal".
A tumour's \note{origin} and microbiology also play a large role in determining its effects on its environment.
Gliomas are often of complex structure, with infiltrating portions and peri-tumoural edoema blurring the distinction between tumour and non-tumour tissue.
Meningiomas, on the other hand, and some types of astrocytoma, are entirely \note{??} separate from brain tissues and can strongly displace neighbouring structures instead of infiltrating.

This project is concerned with the visualisation of cerebral white matter tracts, and therefore this review with focus on those indications and interventions in which damage to and navigation of such structures is of concern.
This is generally not the case for posterior fossa and suprasellar lesions.
Brainstem tumours are often not candidates for surgical removal, due to their precarious locations limiting access and posing too high risks to vital brainstem function.
The following discussions apply to lesions in the cerebral hemispheres and thalamus, candidates for biopsy or resection via craniotomy.

\subsection{Lesion resection}

\note{Focus on tumours, but could also be epilepsy resections.
Cover extent of resection (measurement, definitions etc.), biopsy, relationship between EOR and outcomes}

One might think that the goal of a resection surgery would be the removal of the target lesions.
However, things are not so simple.
While the ideal outcome may, in many cases, be the complete removal of all diseased tissue, in many cases this scenario would conflict with other factors to be balanced, such as the health of surrounding brain structures and other postoperative outcomes.
A central concept to these trade-offs is that of \gls{eor}, or the amount of diseased tissue \note{just say tumour? does eor apply to epilepsy too?} successfully removed by surgery.
While on the surface, \gls{eor} appears a straightforward concept, it nonetheless warrants its own discussion as its definition is often ill-defined while at the same time \gls{eor} plays a central role in studies of surgery efficacy and outcomes.

On paper, \gls{eor} is easily defined: the percentage of tumour tissue resected.
In practice, accurately measuring \gls{eor} is essentially impossible.
The most natural approach is to measure the volume of the lesion before and after surgery as it appears on imaging.
In nearly all cases \note{?}, this measurement is simply done by taking the diameter of the lesion on a single or maybe multiple slices, which will give an accurate result only for perfectly spherical tumours.
This also can't account for resected portions of the tumour being filled with fluid, or differing amounts of tissue compression caused by mass effect and postoperative brain shift.
Volumetric analysis, in which the entire lesion is segmented on pre- and postoperative imaging, is becoming more common and provides a far closer \gls{eor} estimate.
This still relies on accurate segmentation, whether manual or automatic, which poses a problem when tumour tissue, healthy brain tissue or odoema become radiologically indistinguishable.
In any case, unless a tumour is entirely encapsulated \note{by a membrane? is this possible?} or supratotal resection is performed \note{define}, microscopic tumour cell residues, invisible to the eye and on scans, are bound to remain.

Studies reporting \gls{eor} often don't report to specific numerical values, but instead group resections into broad categories, the most common being subtotal resection (STR), near total resection \note{?}, gross total resection (GTR) and supratotal resection.
It's common for these categories are judged by the neurosurgeon or radiologist using subjective assessments such as whether or not tumour residue is visible in the resection cavity or on postoperative scan, which is known to be highly variable, subjective and inaccurate.\autocite{Sezer2020,Lau2018}
There is no general consensus on how these categories are defined, which makes comparison between studies difficult.
Over time, the definitions for \gls{eor} have evolved with the availability of measurement equipment, and the current gold standard for quantifying \gls{eor} is with volumetric measurement on pre- and postoperative imaging.\autocite{Rincon-Torroella2019}
Even so, some studies only provide volumetric \gls{eor} in absolute terms, without taking into account the original tumour size, whereas a percentage reduction in volume is the preferred measurement.\autocite{Ius2012,Rincon-Torroella2019,Smith2008} \note{cite}

This inconsistency in the reporting of \gls{eor} is one factor complicating the study of the effect of \gls{eor} on clinical outcomes.
\note{defs: lgg = grades 1-2, hgg = grades 3-4, glioblastoma = grade 4 glioma}
For many tumour types, particularly aggressive tumours such as \glspl{hgg}, subtotal resection is \note{never} curative even with adjuvant therapy.
Sometimes the risk to quality of life and postoperative neurological function associated with \gls{gtr} negates the potential oncological benefits, especially where even \gls{gtr} cannot eliminate the chances of recurrence.
\Gls{gtr} has been shown to increase survival outcomes over \gls{str} across age groups in both high\autocite{Hatoum2022, Han2020, Adams2016, McCrea2015, Bloch2012, McGirt2009, Kramm2006} and low grade \autocite{Keles2001, Pollack1995, Sanai2008} gliomas.
In \gls{lgg}, particularly in paediatric patients, \gls{gtr} is becoming the most recommended treatment, as it complete resection leads to very low chance of recurrence.\autocite{Berger1994}
In particular, \glspl{lgg} residues risk evolving into malignant \glspl{hgg} which are far harder to treat.
More recent studies have even argued for supratotal resection, beyond the margins of any abnormal enhancing areas on T1w and FLAIR T2w scans, as reviewed in \textcite{deLeeuw2019}.
There is some evidence \autocite{Yordanova2011} that supratotal resection in \glspl{lgg} is followed by fewer cases of malignant transformation and improved progression-free survival.
However, there remains a distinct lack of robust comparison with appropriately matched controls in this area, along with numerous confounding factors that make interpretation of such results difficult.
With most studies investigating the effects of \gls{eor} on postsurgical outcomes being limited to retrospective analyses \note{or prospective without randomisation}, selection biases are bound to confound any conclusions that can be drawn from the comparative results.\autocite{deLeeuw2019,Keles2001}
One might expect supratotal resection of \gls{lgg} to be associated with more postoperative neurological deficits, and indeed one study published in 2019 found higher probabilities of immediate postoperative deficits in supratotal versus total resection, but found that at three month and one year follow-up the deficits were significantly reversed and comparable between total and supratotal groups.\autocite{Rossi2019a}
In \textcite{Gil-Robles2010}, authors argue for a more conservative resection margin in WHO grade II gliomas to protect functional structures.
A further consideration on the feasibility of \gls{gtr} or supratotal resection is neuroplasticity.
Slowly growing, low grade tumours may lead to functional reorganisation of surrounding brain tissue, enabling the safe removal of a greater margin of tissue \note{??}. \autocite{Rossi2019a}
For example, different tumour subtypes may lend themselves more or less easily to greater \gls{eor}, or arise more frequently in eloquent areas of the brain, where an aggressive resection strategy is likely to be discounted.\autocite{deLeeuw2019}
\Glspl{lgg} tend to occur more frequently in highly eloquent cortical regions than \glspl{hgg} \autocite{Duffau2004}
In \glspl{hgg}, one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, the justification for aggressive \gls{gtr} or even supratotal resection is far weaker, given the worse outcomes associated with \gls{hgg} and the low chance of cure.
In that light, patient quality of life becomes a stronger consideration when balancing the aims of surgery, an minimising any potential neurological sequelae, even if that means leaving visible tumour residue, can become the greater priority.
In adults, maximal safe resection, combined with adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy, has been the established standard of care for some time.
It has been less clear, however, whether the same should apply in paediatric \gls{hgg} patients.
For one thing, the most prevalent anatomical locations in which \gls{hgg} arise differ between adults and children.\note{is this true? what are most prev adult sites? Duffau2004}
Paediatric gliomas frequently arise in highly eloquent and high risk \note{??} areas such as thalamus and brain stem.\note{\autocite{Ostrom2015}??}, with the risk of long-term disability particularly \note{undesirable} in children.
A recent systematic review published in 2022 analysed 37 articles to assess the association between \gls{eor} and survival in paediatric patients with \gls{hgg}.\autocite{Hatoum2022}
Notwithstanding the difficulties in consistently defining and reporting \gls{eor} as discussed above, the study found strong evidence for \note{significantly} improved overall survival in \gls{gtr} over \gls{str} of gliomas located in the cerebral hemispheres, but no association between \gls{eor} and survival was observed in midline cases.
The authors emphasise that midline (thalamic and brain stem) gliomas are not often indicated for aggressive resection due to the elevated risk to critical neurological structures, and the lack of observed association may yet stem from measurement biases, including lower sample size and the pooling of histologically distinct tumour types which may respond differently to treatment \note{check this understanding}.
However, no comparison was made for post-operative functional neurological outcomes, and thus only captures part of the picture considering the factors contributing to a decision to pursue aggressive surgery.

New postoperative neurological deficits occur in over a third of glioma surgeries \autocite{Zetterling2020a}, although most patients improve significantly over longer-term followup.
Unsurprisingly, higher chances of postoperative deficits were associated with higher \gls{eor} and with tumours situated in eloquent areas.\autocite{Zetterling2020a}
In some surgeries, there is no hope whatsoever of completely removing the tumour, as treatment will be delivered via adjuvant therapy.
In these cases, the goal of surgery may be debulking of the lesion to relieve pressure on the brain and reduce neurological deficits.
In debulking surgeries, there is no need to attempt to fully resect the tumour, instead a conservative strategy is chosen and no risks involving surrounding functional tissue is taken.
In certain types of tumour, particularly when a combined treatment approach of surgery and radiotherapy is taken, little evidence has been found that \gls{gtr} offers greater tumour-related (that is to say, neurological condition affected by the presence of the tumour) outcomes than subtotal resection, while increasing risk to surrounding brain tissue.
On the other hand, certain types of tumour, in particular lower grade and less aggressive types, show a lower risk of recurrence and malignant transformation when radically resected, offering a particularly good long-term outlook.
Increasingly, physicians have advocating for \gls{gtr} as the standard treatment for \gls{lgg} and maximal safe resection for \gls{hgg}. \autocite{Rincon-Torroella2019}
This comes with the caveat that tumours of lower malignancy are also those found to be more operable, muddying the causal link between overall survival and extent of resection.\autocite{Weller2021}
What's more, post-operative neurological deficits themselves have a negative impact on overall survival.\note{cite}
The European Association of Neuro-Onocology's recommendation, as of 2021, is that prevention of new neurological deficits should be prioritised over maximal extent of resection in the surgical treatment of gliomas.\autocite{Weller2021}

\subsection{Surgical neuronavigation}

\note{All the various tools and gizmos for guided surgery. Split into preoperative planning and intraoperative use.
Include functional imaging (EEG, fMRI, EEG), structural, tractography, DES, awake surgery/monitoring and intraoperative imaging.}

The successful balancing of maximum safe resection and preservation of neurological function is the overall goal of neurosurgical resection.
Tumours can interact with their surroundings in a number of ways, depending on the nature and location of the neoplasm.
\note{anything about de novo vs secondary tumours?}
Some tumours are encapsulated and displace tissue as they grow.
On the one hand, such separation can make operating easier as the distinction between tumour and healthy tissue is clear, but on the other hand, such tumours can exert dangerous amounts of pressure on displaced tissues, leading to neurological impairments and urgent need for surgical debulking.
Other tumours cause almost no spatial displacement of brain tissue, with cancer cells instead infiltrating the brain and blurring the boundaries between disease and healthy brain.
Infiltrating tumours are difficult to operate on due to the risk if injury to eloquent tissue, and are instead often conservatively debulked and treated with radiation or chemotherapy.
Many tumours are of \note{combination type}, with both a tumour core and infiltrating boundary.

In order to minimise risk to adjacent structures, a neurosurgical team has a wealth of tools at their disposal, including structural imaging and functional mapping.

\paragraph*{Preoperative imaging}

\note{change to perioperative imaging? mention postop scans, usually checking for residuals/confirming EOR}

Preoperatively, structural and functional non-invasive imaging are used for surgical planning.
At this stage the goal is to assess the interaction between diseased and healthy tissues, map out a safe operative corridor to access the lesion, and determine the appropriate \gls{eor} to aim for based on risk to surrounding structures and degree of infiltration.
Functional \gls{mri} is used at this stage to map out cortical areas of functional importance that lie in proximity to the lesion, principally the motor and language cortices \note{but also others?}.
Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation is another non-invasive functional mapping technique.
In epilepsy cases, \gls{eeg} may be employed to monitor epileptogenic regions.
Structural imaging also play an important role in planning.
\Gls{ct} can indicate calcified regions \note{is ct actually used for planning??}.
Multi-contrast \gls{mri}, including FLAIR, T1w and T2w imaging sequences, each provide unique contrasts for visualising different aspects of a tumour, such as necrotic and infiltrating regions, which can aid in determining what \gls{eor} to aim for or which region of the tumour to target for biopsy.
Angiography \note{mri, ct?} can also be employed for determining the tumour's and surrounding vasculature.
Preoperative imaging has greatly improved the scope of cases for which surgical resection is now a possibility, by enabling the planning of safe routes to regions of the brain previously considered inoperable, for example thalamic tumours \note{and some brain stem?}.
These preoperative images can also be used intraoperatively for guidance throughout the procedure.
Functional MRI can guide the use of DES-based functional mapping after craniotomy, and in some cases, for example surgery near the language centres in patients where awake surgery is not possible, action as a substitute for DES.\note{??}

\paragraph*{White matter mapping}

\note{Copied from HBM manuscript; this might be better placed as a summary in the "problem statement" part?}

In neurosurgical settings, tractography is frequently based on \gls{dt} fibre orientation models \autocite{Toescu2020, Yang2021} and deterministic tracking algorithms, for example as implemented in Brainlab's iPlan\textregistered (single tensor)\autocite{Brainlab2012} and Elements (dual tensor)\autocite{Sollmann2020a} Fibre Tracking applications (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany) which use a version of fibre assignment by continuous tracking, or FACT. \autocite{Mori1999}
In research settings, \gls{dt} models and deterministic algorithms have long since given way to multi-fibre models and probabilistic algorithms.
These include multi-tensor models,\autocite{Peled2006} Q-ball imaging\autocite{Tuch2004}, ball-and-sticks\autocite{Behrens2003} and \gls{csd}-derived fibre orientation distribution functions on the modelling side, and probtrackx \autocite{Behrens2007}, first or second-order integration over FODs (iFOD1/iFOD2)\autocite{Tournier2010} and particle filter tractography \autocite{Girard2014} on the algorithms side.

Regardless of the particular combination of fibre model, algorithm and tracking criteria, streamline tractography is compromised by weaknesses that can lead to flawed results or interpretations if not accounted for.\autocite{Rheault2020, Schilling2022, Schilling2019}
Although probabilistic tractography is generally considered to be superior to deterministic tractography in its ability to reconstruct bundles more completely, especially ones with complex shapes, sharp bends and fanning, this improved sensitivity is accompanied by a high propensity for false positive streamlines.\autocite{Maier-Hein2017}
As a result, targeted reconstruction of specific bundles using probabilistic tractography requires constraining with inclusion and exclusion regions of interest (ROIs), whose manual placement is labour intensive and demands expert neuroanatomical knowledge.

Nonetheless, there is growing consensus that (pending appropriate regulatory approval) the clinical community ought to adopt probabilistic, non-DT tractography,\autocite{Yang2021, Beare2022, Petersen2017} given, among other issues, the low sensitivity of DT deterministic tractography particularly around lesions.\autocite{Ashmore2020}
There is evidence that a shift is underway, at least in the context of presurgical planning,\autocite{Toescu2020} although there is the question of whether the adoption of advanced tractography is being driven from the supply or demand side.
Until recently, commercially available neurosurgical navigation platforms have exclusively supported \gls{dt} modelling and deterministic tractography (a recent exception is the Medtronic Stealth\texttrademark{}  Tractography application (Medtronic, USA), which implements \gls{csd}-based tractography\autocite{Pozzilli2023} as well as DT).
This lack of readily available alternatives in the neurosurgeon's workflow and certified for safe clinical use is undoubtedly a major factor in the persisting preference for deterministic methods in clinical practice.
But perhaps demand for probabilistic tractography in neuronavigational software has also been understandably muted on account of its lower ease of use and practicality.
DT acquisitions can have as few as 6 diffusion weighted directions, resulting in much shorter scan times compared to full HARDI acquisitions.
Deterministic tracking itself is rapid, and the placement of ROI need not be as strict as with probabilistic tractography owing to a lower sensitivity to false positives.\autocite{ODonnell2017}
A lack of availability of the necessary expertise and time limits neurosurgical centres' access to state-of-the-art tractography.\autocite{Toescu2020}
There is thus an unmet need for reliable, automated tract segmentation techniques that can rapidly provide consistent and complete tract reconstructions for clinical use.

tracking (dt especially) bad in areas of ``disturbed diffusion" Kuhnt2013

\paragraph*{Brain shift}

The dynamic conditions of brain surgery results in the unpredictable and often significantly strong movement, compression and deformation of tissue referred to as brain shift.
A range of factors contribute to this phenomenon, including the draining of \gls{csf}, sagging due to gravity, decompression of tissue surrounding resected tumour, swelling, craniotomy herniation \note{is that a thing?} and the effects of surgical instruments.
These effects are often \note{competing}, for example swelling and tumour debulking can cause brain tissue to shift towards a craniotomy, while the effects of gravity and \gls{csf} drainage can have the opposite effect.
The amount and direction of shifting is unpredictable, ranging from \note{1-10mm}, making accounting for it with predictive modelling very difficult.

Brain shift can affect the neurosurgeons perception of the shape and location of the target lesion \note{pure speculation} and invalidate preoperative imaging used for navigation.
\note{cue various studies backing this up.}
There have been attempts to address the problem of brain shift by dynamically adjusting preoperative imaging according to (sparse) intraoperative data, for example optical imaging of the cortical surface, or using ultrasound. \note{does this belong in next section?}
Many neurosurgeons rely on their intuition to update their mental map of the surgical site throughout the procedure.
On more advanced neuronavigational platforms which integrate preoperative imaging and intraoperative data such as \gls{des} stimulation sites, brain shift can lead to misleading and inaccurate depictions of the spatial relationships between tumour and surrounding structures.

\paragraph*{Intraoperative imaging}

To mitigate the effects of brain shift on neuronavigational accuracy, new structural and functional guidance information can be acquired intraoperatively.
Once more, different modalities offer different strengths and weaknesses depending on the circumsances.
Ultrasound imaging can probe into tissue, is safe \note{?} and can be operated at the surgical table without needing to move the patient.
With the skull, which usually hinders the use of \gls{us} in the brain, out of the way, \gls{us} is an effective way of assessing the situation behind the resection cavity wall.
\note{is it used for doppler? tumour?}
Image quality is limited and can be difficult to compare with other imaging modalities such as \gls{mri}.
Specialised \gls{ct} systems can also be utilised intraoperatively \note{[examples]}, but they present additional patient exposure to ionising radiation which is to be avoided wherever possible.

Intraoperative \gls{mri} is becoming and increasingly common addition to neurosurgical set-ups.
This includes low field open bore systems which can be installed in the operating room, and allow for easy transfer of the patient into the scanner, as well as full high-field (\note{>1T}) systems which acquire far higher quality images at the expense of practicality, as interrupting surgery for an extended scan session and safely transferring a patient from the operating table to inside the bore of the scanner is a substantial logistical and medical challenge.
Challenges notwithstanding, intraoperative \gls{mri} is incredibly valuable for determining surgical margins and providing guidance after the effects of intraoperative deformations.

Numerous works demonstrate the effect of \gls{imri} in improving postsurgical outcomes.
In many cases the alternative is acquiring post-operative imaging to assess the extent of resection, presenting additional burden to already very sick patients, perhaps sedation to paediatric patients.
If it is determined on post-operative imaging that intolerable tumour residue remains, then the subsequent re-operation, re-opening of the craniotomy, general anaesthetic and all the medical and practical burdens they represent could have been avoided using \gls{imri}.
Most commonly, sequences providing good anatomical tissue contrast are used to determine the tumour boundaries, any residue that can be safely resected.
Simple diffusion sequences may also be utilised to assess changes to perfusion \note{?}.
Higher angular resolution diffusion sequences are far less common in intraoperative settings, thanks to longer scan times and a lack of computational infrastructure for processing the raw data \note{fair?}, however they are still valuable for imaging white matter.
Modern scanners can compute basic diffusion tensor directionally encoded colour maps which can help radiologists coarsely identify white matter pathways in the tumour neighbourhood.
In \note{nimsky??} intraoperative diffusion \gls{mri} successfully imaged the shifting of white matter tracts, and \note{??} measured the directions and magnitude of shifting, determining that it was all quite variable and unpredictable.
