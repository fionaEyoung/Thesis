\section{Theory fundamentals}
\label{theory}

\note{This will cover the more theoretical background prerequisites, covering the fundamental concepts on the biological side (neuroanatomy and cellular physiology, maybe some oncology?) and physical side (MR physics)}

\subsection{Neuroanatomy: Micro to macro}

\subsubsection{Cells of the brain}

\note{neurons, glial cells, axons and basics of neural signalling.}

The building blocks of living organisms begin at the level of molecules and atoms, through macromolecules such as proteins and lipids, cell organelles, cells, tissues, organs and finally whole organisms.
For the purposes of this report, though, we can start at the cellular level, and focus on a single organ: the brain.
Brain tissues consist of numerous cell types.
The principle functional cells are neurons, which perform the computations underpinning all aspects of neural function. They are supported, and outnumbered ( by a \note{factor of?}), by a network of glial cells, each with specialised functions.

\subsubsection{Neuroanatomy}

\note{Structure of the brain, including different sections (hind, mid, forbrain etc.) and tissue types.
Discuss the lobes, cortical regions and functional divisions, then white matter tracts.}

On the macro scale, the human brain can be divided into \note{several} different divisions, starting with the at the most macro scale the hind-, mid- and forebrain.
The hind brain comprises the caudal brainstem (pons and medulla) and cerebellum.
The former forms a continuum between the forebrain to the spinal cord and houses the bodies vital and involuntary functions and control of the cranial nerves.

The brainstem is further divided into, moving inferior to superior, the medulla, pons and midbrain.
Posterior to the brainstem, and seated within the posterior fossa, sits the cerebellum, or "little brain",
a highly specialised and complex structure whose full significance in cerebral function is yet to be fully described, but which is conventionally known to play an integral role in automated motor and speech functions.
The cerebellum connects with the brain via three white matter bundles, the inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, of which the middle is the largest and forms the bulk of the pons \note{?}.

The forebrain consists of the diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) and the telecephalon (cerebral hemispheres).
Evolutionarily speaking, the cerebral hemispheres are the youngest developments, responsible for much of the complex neural functionality we associated with the general intelligence of modern humans, as well as personality and consciousness \note{??}.



\subsection{MRI Physics}

\subsubsection{Resonance and relaxation}

\note{Basics of resonance, magnetisation, spin-spin / spin-lattice relaxation}

MRI images are obtained by detecting the spin relaxation resonance stuff of principally hydrogen atoms (which are abundant in the body in H2O molecules).

The application of a strong linear magnetic field causes all spins to align themselves with the direction of the field. This is the bulk magnetisation $M_z$, in its "relaxed" state (aligned with B0).
The ratio of spin magnetic moments aligned with the external field is increased, \note{as the field imparts energy or something causing magnetic moments to preferentially be aligned} resulting in a net magnetisation along the orientation of $B_0$, termed $M_z$.
Alignment of a magnetic moment with $B_0$ (spin up) is energetically favourable of the opposite spin down state to the tune of $\Delta E = \gamma h B_0$ \note{explain vars}.
Hence the stronger the external field, the larger the ratio of up to down spins and thus the a larger the magnitude of $M_z$.
As the magnitude of this bulk magnetisation vector underpins the strength of any subsequently sampled signals, stronger bore fields, as a general rule \note{are there exceptions?}, produce images with better \gls{snr}.
In thermal equlibrium, then, the magnetic moments within the sample are precessing at the larmor frequency and entirely out of phase with each other, resulting in no net transverse magnetisation, and with spins aligned preferentially along $B_0$, resulting in maximum longitudinal magnetisation $M_z$.

The manipulation of this net magnetisation vector away from, and subsequent relaxation back to this equilibrium state, is the basis of all signal production in \gls{mri}.
The application of a \gls{rf} pulse, that is, an oscilating magnetic field ($B_1$) precisely at the resonant larmor frequency and perpendicular to $B_0$, enacts two effects on this the bulk magnetisation.
The first is the impartion \note{??} of energy which overcomes $\Delta E$ \note{this is the bit I understand the least} to increase the number of spins in the energetically unfavourable spin-down orientation and thus eliminate the net magnetisation along $B_0$.
The second effect is to sycronise the spins' precession with the rotating \gls{rf} pulse, and by extension with each-other, resulting in a precessing net magnetisation in the transverse plane $M_{xy}$.
\note{but what about 180 degree pulses?}
As soon as the excitation field is switched off, the bulk magnetisation gradually relaxes to equilibrium as the induced effects on the individual moments revert:
interaction with other spins \note{local magnetic fields?} in the molecular environment cause gradual dephasing and consequent reduction in $M_{xy}$ (spin-spin relaxation), while the energy gained from the \gls{rf} pulse is gradually dissipated among the lattice field \note{??} as the spins revert to the stistically fabourable lower energy state in alignment with $B_0$ causing gradual recovery of $M_z$ (spin-lattice relaxation).

The recovery rate of $M_z$ and the rate of decay of $M_{xy}$ are described by the time constants $T1$ and $T2$ respectively, and each depend on the specific molecular environment and are thus tissue-dependent quantities.
It is the varying values of $T1$ and $T2$, as well as the overall differences in proton densities ($PD$) between tissues which lend contrast to MR images.

\subsubsection{Excitation and image acquisition}

\note{How MRI machines work: excitation pulses, effects of different relaxation weightings, examples of different common pulse sequences and their uses}

\paragraph{Generating echos}

Immediatly after application of the \gls{rf} excitation pulse, magnetisation will rapidly return to equilbrium in a spiral pattern \note{see image}.
This rotating magnetisation will induce an oscillating current within a detection coil placed near the sample in a process called \gls{fid}.
This is the most basic form of NMR signal and, since it decays very rapidly \note{isn't useful on it's own for image formation?}
In order to generate signal useful for spatial encoding and image acquisition \note{??} we make use of spin echos and/or gradient echos.

To produce a gradient echo, a readout gradient $G_x$ \note{necessarily?} is applied across the sample causing spins to dephase at different rates according to their local magnetic field $B_0 + G_xx$.
After a time $TE/2$ \note{how long?} the gradient polarity is reversed, and with it the rates of dephasing across the sample.
The effect is that after experiencing equal amounts of time of gradient polarities, the spins find themselves momentarily realigned, forming a peak in bulk transverse magnetisation and associated signal (``echo") at the time period since excitation designated $TE$ (echo time).

Since the reversal of gradient polarity effects only the gradient coil generated fields, the dephasing caused by local inhomogeneities in the $B_0$ field cannot be reversed, and the resulting signal is T2\* weighted. \note{explain T2*}
The FID signal decay is accelerated by the effects of field inhomogeneities, but the signal is in fact not entirely destroyed, it merely becomes disorganised in a manner that can be symmetrically reversed, using the spine echo phenomenon.

Spin echos are generated not through the manipulation of graident polarity, but through a complete inversion of spin orientation. \note{?}
At time $TE/2$, an additional ``refocussing" \gls{rf} pulse introduces a 180$\deg$ rotation, effectively flipping the system in the $xy$ plane \note{how to describe this more mathematically?}.
Now, those spins that are, due to slightly higher local field strength, precessing fastest, have accumulated a certain amount of phase ``ahead" of the average.
After being flipped, they are precessing at the same speed but no lag behind the average by the same phase difference.
Thus after an additional symmetrical time span of $TE/2$, the uneven effects of field inhomogeneities have been cancelled out and the spins find themselves briefly refocussed, producing a spin echo signal peak at $TE$.

Spin echo sequences benefit from the overcoming of T2* decay to produce signals with pure T2 weighting. \note{why is this useful?}
On the other hand, the need for an additional \gls{rf} pulse introduces instrumentation delay times and corresponding loss of signal magnitude.
Gradient echo sequences can work with shorter TEs \note{true?} and \note{...thus?}

\note{this section is pretty ropey but will do for now as a scaffold}

\paragraph{Spatial encoding}

The signal induced in a reciever coil is a combination of contributions from spins located throughout the excited sample.
The attribution of signal contributions to positions in 3D space is achieved with slice selection, phase encoding and frequency encoding.
In theory, these three encoding dimensions can apply to any permutation of the three spatial axes, but in practice, and for the purposes of this description, it's easiest and conventional to select slices along the $z$-axis, parallel with the main magnetic field. \note{the other two are often interchanged in practice}

\note{the following description is specifically 2DFT method, mention?}

Slice selection ensures that the \gls{rf} pulse only excites a specific slab within the sample, and is achieved by overlaying a magnetic field gradient along $z$, altering the larmor frequencies of the spins along $z$ according to $\omega_0 + \gamma G_zz$.
A \gls{rf} pulse with (central) frequency $\frac{1}{2\pi}\omega_0 + \gamma G_zz_c$ \note{the 2 pi thing is about converting from angular frequency?} will excite spins located only at position $z_c$.
All other spins in the sample will be unaffected by subsequent manipulation of the magnetisation vector throughout the pulse sequence.

Within the selected plain, the manipulation of two spin quantities determines 2D localisation.
The first is spin precession frequency, which can be modulated along an axis in the same manner as is used in slice selection -- a magnetic field gradient $G_{fe}$ (applied, for the purposes of this description, along $x$) imparts spatially varying frequencies according to $\omega_0 + \gamma G_{fe}x$.
The frequency encoding gradient is applied throughout signal readout. \note{explain more?}
The reciever coil digitally samples the echo signal a discreet points, with the number of samples corresponding to the image matrix size along the $x$ axis.

The second is spin phase, or a spin's instantaneous angle in the $xy$ plane relative to \note{what?}.
Before signal readout, a phase encoding gradient is applied along $y$ for a time $\Delta t_{pe}$, after which spins precessing faster have accummulated a larger phase difference $\phi_{pe}$ over those experiencing lower total field strength, to the tune of $\phi_{pe}=\gamma G_{pe}y \Delta t_{pe}$.
Since the phase encoding gradient is switched off before signal readout, those phase differences become locked in and serve to localise spins along the phase encoding direction.
A single application of the phase encoding gradient provides insufficient information for determining $y$-coordinates of recieved signal components.
The excitation--phase-encoding--echo-readout sequence is repeated with varying phase-encoding magnitudes.
The number of phase encoding steps corresponds to the image matrix size along the $y$ axis.

\paragraph{Pulse sequences}



\subsubsection{Diffusion MRI}

\note{First describe diffusion in general but stick to tissue, i.e. restricted diffusion. Cover the different types of diffusion in different tissues in the brain, timescales etc.
Then look at the mechanism of diffusion MRI acquisition, pulse sequence and parameters e.g. b values.
Also mention common artefacts.}

In living tissue, water molecules are not free to diffusion for long distances in all directions. Some tissue environments are highly constrained, with diffusion occurring principally along a single direction \note{too simplistic}, while in others, fewer barriers allow free diffusion.

\paragraph{Diffusion weighting}

Any MR pulse sequence can be modified to introduce additional sensitisation to brownian motion, or diffusion weighting, in addition to the existing T1 and T2 based constrasts.
This is achieved through the application of a pair of diffusion sensitisation graident pulses prior to echo generation and signal readout.

To illustrate the concept, we will consider the application of diffusion weighting along a single orthogonal direction, e.g. $G_x$.
After slice selection and \gls{rf} excitation, a gradient of magnitude $G_d$ is applied along $x$ for time period $\delta$ before it is reversed in polarity for subsequent $\delta$.
Consider a spin which is stationary along $x=x_1$ throught the application of these gradients.
Initially, it will gain a phase $\phi_1$ proportional to it's position along the gradient $x_1$ according to $\gamma G_d \delta x_1$.
After gradient reversal, having not changed position $x=x_2=x_1$ it will gain the opposite phase $\phi_2 = -\phi_1$, resulting in a net phase change after diffusion sensitisation of $0$.
Conversely, a spin which is net motion along $x$ will experience different gradient strengths across the two time points and will experience a net dephasing according to $\Delta\phi = \gamma G_d \delta (x_2 - x_1)$ \note{replace with integral form} and corresponding signal loss.
On subsequent signal sampling, those voxels in which diffusion was high will have have a high degree of diffusion weighting-induced dephasing and exhibit a corresponding signal dropout.
In those voxels with low diffusion, phase coherence will remain relatively intact after diffusion senistisation and signal loss will be correspondingly minimal.

\paragraph{Echo planar imaging}

Since diffusion imaging, in particular \gls{hardi}, involves the acquisition of numerous image volumes with different diffusion weightings, scan times can be particularly long.
Depending on the image resolution, number of diffusion weighted directions, and many other factors, scan times can run into the tens of minutes and even hours.
Aside from the cost and practicalities of longer scans, there is also the increased risk of motion artifacts.
So it is that the dominant \note{only?} type of pulse sequence used in \gls{dmri} is \gls{epi}.
In \gls{epi}, all phase encoding intervals are acquired after only a single \gls{rf} excitation.
\Gls{epi} can employ both gradient and spin echos and there are numerous different variations and associated contrast \note{??}, but for the purpose of this summary we will focus on the typical \gls{epi} sequence employed for diffusion weighted imaging.
