  abstract = {Transformation of spherical harmonics under rotation is a major problem in many areas of theoretical and applied science. While elegantly and efficiently solved for complex spherical harmonics with Wigner D- and d-matrices, extending this method to real spherical harmonics (RSH) faces serious difficulties not yet overcome. This work presents novel explicit formulas and recurrence relations for building RSH rotation matrices with lesser complexity and better computational efficiency. It also gives general closed forms of Wigner d-matrix elements in terms of the rotation angle instead of half this angle as is usual. © 2013 Author(s).},

  abstract = {The coefficient of association of Forbes indicates the amount of association be- tween two given species compared to the amount of association between them expected by chance. In order to provide a simple direct measure of the amount of association of one species with another the association index is proposed. If a is the number of random samples of a given series in which species A occurs and h is the number of samples in which another species B occurs together with A, then the association index B/A = h/a. Similarly, if b is the number of samples in which species B occurs, then the associa- tion index A/B = h/b. There is also proposed a coincidence index, 2h/(a + b), whose value is intermediate between the two reciprocal association indices. As a measure of the statistical reliability of the deviation shown by the samples of a given series from the amount of associa- tion expected by chance, the chi-square test may be used.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes nonparametric deconvolution density estimation overS2. Here we would think of theS2elements of interest being corrupted by randomSO(3) elements (rotations). The resulting density on the observations would be a convolution of theSO(3) density with the trueS2density. Consequently, the methodology, as in the Euclidean case, would be to use Fourier analysis onSO(3) andS2, involving rotational and spherical harmonics, respectively. We especially consider the case where the deconvolution operator is a bounded operator lowering the Sobolev order by a finite amount. Consistency results are obtained with rates of convergence calculated under the expectedS2and Sobolev square norms that are proportionally inverse to some power of the sample size. As an example we introduce the rotational version of the Laplace distribution. © 1998 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Fourier analysis, and representation of circular distributions in terms of their Fourier coefficients, is quite commonly discussed and used for model-free inference such as testing uniformity and symmetry, in dealing with 2-dimensional directions. However, a similar discussion for spherical distributions, which are used to model 3-dimensional directional data, is not readily available in the literature in terms of their harmonics. This paper, in what we believe is the first such attempt, looks at probability distributions on a unit sphere through the perspective of spherical harmonics, analogous to the Fourier analysis for distributions on a unit circle. Representation of any continuous spherical density in terms of spherical harmonics is given, and such series expansions provided for some commonly used spherical distributions, as well as for two new spherical distributions that are introduced. Through the prism of harmonic analysis, one can look at the mean direction, dispersion, and various forms of symmetry for these models in a nonparametric setting. Aspects of distribution-free inference such as estimation and large-sample tests for various symmetries, are provided, each type of symmetry being characterized through its harmonics. The paper concludes with a real-data example analyzing the longitudinal sunspot activity.},

  abstract = {This paper presents theoretical analysis and software implementation for real harmonics analysis on the special orthogonal group. Noncommutative harmonic analysis for complex-valued functions on the special orthogonal group has been studied extensively. However, it is customary to treat real harmonic analysis as a special case of complex harmonic analysis, and there have been limited results developed specifically for real-valued functions. Here, we develop a set of explicit formulas for real-valued irreducible unitary representations on the special orthogonal group, and provide several operational properties, such as derivatives, sampling, and Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. Furthermore, we implement both of complex and real harmonics analysis on the special orthogonal group into an open source software package that utilizes parallel processing through the OpenMP library. The efficacy of the presented results are illustrated by benchmark studies and an application to spherical shape matching.},

The scheme is based on a network of evenly distributed grid points, defined by repeated subdivision of a spherical icosahedron. Delanuany triangulation is then used to obtain bin perimeters for each grid point, which results in a network of bins that are evenly distributed across the entire globe and have uniform area. A modified winding rule is used to determine which datapoints are in which bin. This binning method is especially suited to remote sensing applications involving datasets covering polar regions, where conventional rectangular latitude/longitude bins introduce distortion and streaking into the binned data if noise is present. It also has the property that adjacent bins overlap, providing Nyquist sampling and preventing spatial aliasing. Tests on synthetic data show that this icosahedral binning scheme preserves underlying data trends and is robust to noise. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
