  abstract = {The goal of epilepsy surgery is the removal or disconnection of seizure foci with maximal preservation of neurological function, and particularly those functions considered eloquent, within the realm of fine motor and related sensory functions. Children, more often than adults, require general anesthesia for such surgery, and the avoidance of motor or tactile sensory deficits requires techniques that identify and protect the Rolandic cortical sulci. This chapter emphasizes the use of somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) methods, direct cortical mapping, and monitoring techniques including cortical, subcortical, and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES). The recent preoperative use of navigated transcranial magnetic motor stimulation is presented, along with additional monitoring ideas for future.},

  abstract = {While resection or disconnection of an epileptogenic lesion may lead to the cessation of seizures, damage to essential networks produces permanent deficits. As current perspectives in neurosurgery have moved from strict cortical localizationism to hodology, intraoperative recognition and preservation of essential cortical–subcortical structures have become a crucial goal for surgical resection. Although the resurgence of awake surgery and the advent of tractography have allowed for unprecedented progression in knowledge and treatment of lesions involving subcortical white matter structures, other strategies may have to be applied in conditions of scarce compliance, such as surgery in pediatric patients. In this scenario, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOMN) may be the strategy of choice, allowing for the identification of functionally defined but anatomically ambiguous eloquent areas and respective white matter connectivity. Here, we review current advances and future perspectives in mapping subcortical networks in children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Despite the disabling deficits of motor apraxia and sensory ataxia resulting from intraoperative injury of the superior thalamocortical tracts (TCTs), region-specific electrophysiological localization is currently lacking. Herein, the authors describe a novel TCT mapping paradigm. METHODS Three patients, 1 asleep and 2 awake, underwent glioma resection affecting primarily the somatosensory cortex and underlying TCT. Stimulation was performed at the median, ulnar, and posterior tibial nerves. Parameters comprised single anodal pulses (duration 200–500 μsec, 2.1–4.7 Hz) with a current ranging from 10 to 25 mA. Recordings were captured with a bipolar stimulation probe, avoiding the classic collision technique. Positive localization sites were used to tractographically reconstruct the TCT in the third case. RESULTS Employing one electrophysiological paradigm, the TCT was localized subcortically in all 3 cases by using a bipolar probe, peak range of 19.6–29.2 msec, trough of 23.3–34.8 msec, stimulation range of 10–25 mA. In the last case, tractographic reconstruction of the TCT validated a highly accurate TCT localization within a specific region of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. CONCLUSIONS The authors describe the first electrophysiological technique for intraoperative localization and protection of the TCT in both asleep and awake craniotomies with tractographic validation, while avoiding the collision paradigm. None of the above paradigms have been previously reported. More data are required to further validate this technique.},

  abstract = {Consequential works in cognitive neuroscience have led to the formulation of an interactive dual-stream model of language processing: the dorsal stream may process the phonological aspects of language, whereas the ventral stream may process the semantic aspects of language. While it is well-accepted that the dorsal route is subserved by the arcuate fasciculus, the structural connectivity of the semantic ventral stream is a matter of dispute. Here we designed a longitudinal study to gain new insights into this central but controversial question. Thirty-one patients harboring a left diffuse low-grade glioma—a rare neurological condition that infiltrates preferentially white matter associative pathways—were assessed with a prototypical task of language (i.e. verbal fluency) before and after surgery. All were operated under local anesthesia with a cortical and subcortical brain mapping—enabling to identify and preserve eloquent structures for language. We performed voxel-based lesion-symptom (VLSM) analyses on pre- and postoperative behavioral data. Preoperatively, we found a significant relationship between semantic fluency scores and the white matter fibers shaping the ventro-lateral connectivity (P~{$<~$}0.05 corrected). The statistical map was found to substantially overlap with the spatial position of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (37.7~\%). Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between semantic fluency scores and the infiltration volumes in this fasciculus (r~=~−0.4, P~=~0.029). Postoperatively, VLSM analyses were inconclusive. Taken as a whole and when combined with the literature data, our findings strengthen the view that the IFOF plays an essential role in semantic processing and may subserve the direct ventral pathway of language.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose There is limited standardization of acquisition and processing methods in diffusion tractography for pre-surgical planning, leading to a range of approaches. In this study, a number of representative acquisition variants and post processing methods are considered, to assess their importance when implementing a clinical tractography program. Methods Diffusion MRI was undertaken in ten healthy volunteers, using protocols typical of clinical and research scanning: a 32-direction diffusion acquisition with and without peripheral gating, and a non-gated 64 diffusion direction acquisition. All datasets were post-processed using diffusion tensor reconstruction with streamline tractography, and with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) with both streamline and probabilistic tractography, to delineate the cortico-spinal tract (CST) and optic radiation (OR). The accuracy of tractography results was assessed against a histological atlas using a novel probabilistic Dice overlap technique, together with direct comparison to tract volumes and distance of Meyer’s loop to temporal pole (ML-TP) from dissections studies. Three clinical case studies of patients with space occupying lesions were also investigated. Results Tracts produced by CSD with probabilistic tractography provided the greatest overlap with the histological atlas (overlap scores of 44\% and 52\% for the CST and OR, respectively) and best matched tract volume and ML-TP distance from dissection studies. The acquisition protocols investigated had limited impact on the accuracy of the tractography. In all patients, the CSD based probabilistic tractography created tracts with greatest anatomical plausibility, although in one case anatomically plausible pathways could not be reconstructed without reducing the probabilistic threshold, leading to an increase in false positive tracts. Conclusions Advanced post processing techniques such as CSD with probabilistic tractography are vital for pre-surgical planning. However, overall accuracy relative to dissection studies remains limited.},

To evaluate causes of these differences, we analyzed aspects of care provided to pediatric neuro-oncology patients in a low middle-income South American country. Methods Three methods were used to evaluate treatment of children with brain tumors in Paraguay: (1) a quantitative needs assessment questionnaire for local treating physicians, (2) site visits to assess 3 tertiary care centers in Asunción and a satellite clinic in an underdeveloped area, and (3) interviews with health care workers from relevant disciplines to determine their perceptions of available resources. Treatment failure was defined as abandonment of therapy, relapse, or death. Results All 3 tertiary care facilities have access to chemotherapy and pediatric oncologists but lack training and tools for neuropathology and optimal neurosurgery. The 2 public hospitals also lack access to appropriate radiological tests and timely radiotherapy. These results demonstrate disparities in Paraguay, with rates of treatment failure ranging from 37\% to 83\% among the 3 facilities. Conclusions National and center-specific deficiencies in resources to manage pediatric brain tumors contribute to poor outcomes in Paraguay and suggest that both national and center-specific interventions are warranted to improve care. Disparities in Paraguay reflect different levels of governmental and philanthropic support, program development, and socio-economic status of patients and families, which must be considered when developing targeted strategies to improve management. Effective targeted interventions can serve as a model to develop pediatric brain tumor programs in other low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Preoperative DTI Fiber Tracking (DTI-FT) reconstruction of functional tracts combined with intraoperative subcortical mapping (ISM) is potentially useful to improve surgical procedures in gliomas located in eloquent areas. Aims of the study are: (1) to evaluate the modifications of fiber trajectory induced by the tumor; (2) to validate preoperative DTI-FT results with intraoperative identification of functional subcortical sites through direct subcortical stimulation; (3) to evaluate the impact of preoperative DTI-FT reconstructions in a neuronavigational setup combined with ISM technique on duration and modalities of surgical procedures, and on functional outcome of the patients. Data are available on 64 patients (52 low-grade and 12 high-grade gliomas). DTI-FT was acquired by a 3-T MR scanner with a single-shot EPI sequence (TR/TE 8986/80 ms, b = 1000 s/mm) with gradients applied along 32 non-collinear directions. 3D Fast Field Echo (FFE) T1-weighted imaging (TR/TE 8/4 ms) was performed for anatomic guidance. The corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital and uncinatus fasciculi were reconstructed. Data were transferred to the neuronavigational system. Functional subcortical sites identified during ISM were correlated with fiber tracts depicted by DTI-FT. In high-grade gliomas, DTI-FT depicted tracts mostly at the tumor periphery; in low-grade gliomas, fibers were frequently located inside the tumor mass. There was a high correlation between DTI-FT and ISM (sensitivity for CST = 95\%, language tracts = 97\%). For a proper reconstruction of the tracts, it was necessary to use a low FA threshold of fiber tracking algorithm and to position additional regions of interest (ROIs). The combination of DTI-FT and ISM decreased the duration of surgery, patient fatigue, and intraoperative seizures. Combination of DTI-FT and ISM allows accurate identification of eloquent fiber tracts and enhances surgical performance and safety maintaining a high rate of functional preservation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we used Diffusion-Weighted (DW) MRI tractography to explore tumor-induced alterations of WM architecture without any a priori knowledge about the fiber paths under consideration. We used deterministic multi-fiber tractography to analyze 16 cases of histolog-ically classified brain tumors (meningioma, low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma) to evaluate the integrity of WM bundles in the tumoral region, in relation to the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Our new tractographic approach yielded measures of WM involvement which were strongly correlated with the histopathological features of the tumor (r = 0.83, p = 0.0001). In particular, the number of affected fiber tracts were significantly (p = 0.0006) different among tumor types. Our method proposes a new application of diffusion tractography for the detection of tumor aggressiveness in those cases in which the lesion does not involve any major/known WM paths and when a priori information about the local fiber anatomy is lacking.

Meta-analysis of these techniques for maximizing resection, postoperative functionality, and survival may further validate purported strengths of these techniques compared with standard neuronavigation. Methods: A systematic search of the PubMed database was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines for meta-analysis with the following keywords: “Diffusion tensor imaging” OR “intraoperative MRI” OR “functional MRI” AND “glioma surgery resection outcome.” Articles found to meet inclusion criteria were segregated and analyzed and resulting data were compared with standard neuronavigation (control cohort). Results: A total of 435 articles were identified, with 29 distinct studies meeting inclusion criteria, including DTI (n = 3), fMRI (n = 5), and iMRI (n = 21). Nine studies directly compared results with standard navigation. Mean gross total resection (GTR) rates were not different among cases using DTI, fMRI, iMRI, or traditional neuronavigation (P = 0.136). On controlling for covariates, more patients received GTR in the advanced imaging cohort, although statistically insignificant (46.5\% [95\% confidence interval, 38.0\%–55.0\%] vs. 30.4\% [95\% confidence interval, 11.6\%–49.1\%]; P = 0.127; partial η2 = 0.217). Patients undergoing advanced imaging showed attenuated incidence of postsurgical permanent neurologic deficits, although also statistically insignificant (11.3\% vs. 13.8\%; P = 0.838). Conclusions: Current data are overall insufficient to support the notion that advanced imaging techniques are superior, either as a combined cohort or individually, in achieving GTR, improved symptom resolution, or survival compared with traditional neuronavigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. No age-adjusted or histologic-adjusted assessments of the association between extent of resection and risk of either recurrence or death exist for neurosurgical patients who undergo resection of low-grade glioma using intraoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) guidance. METHODS. The current data included 156 patients who underwent surgical resection of a unifocal, supratentorial, low-grade glioma in the MRI suite at Brigham and Women's Hospital between January 1, 1997, and January 31, 2003. Estimates of disease-free and overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The association between extent of resection and these probabilities was measured using a Cox proportional hazards model. Observed death rates were compared with the expected death rate using age-specific and histologic-specific survival rates obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry. RESULTS. Patients who underwent subtotal resection were at 1.4 times the risk of disease recurrence (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.7-3.1) and at 4.9 times the risk of death (95\% CI, 0.61-40.0) relative to patients who underwent gross total resection. The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year age-adjusted and histologic-adjusted death rates for patients who underwent surgical resection using intraoperative MRI guidance were 1.9\% (95\% CI, 0.3-4.2\%), 3.6\% (95\% CI, 0.4-6.7\%), and 17.6\% (95\% CI, 5.9-29.3\%), respectively: significantly lower than the rates reported using national data bases. CONCLUSIONS. The data from the current study suggested a possible association between surgical resection and survival for neurosurgical patients who underwent surgery for low-grade glioma under intraoperative MRI guidance. Further study within the context of a large, prospective, population-based project will be needed to confirm these findings. © 2005 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {The surgical management of brain tumors is based on the principle that the extent of resection improves patient outcomes. Traditionally, neurosurgeons have considered that lesions in “non-eloquent” cerebrum can be more aggressively surgically managed compared to lesions in “eloquent” regions with more known functional relevance. Furthermore, advancements in multimodal imaging technologies have improved our ability to extend the rate of resection while minimizing the risk of inducing new neurologic deficits, together referred to as the “onco-functional balance.” However, despite the common utilization of invasive techniques such as cortical mapping to identify eloquent tissue responsible for language and motor functions, glioma patients continue to present post-operatively with poor cognitive morbidity in higher-order functions. Such observations are likely related to the difficulty in interpreting the highly-dimensional information these technologies present to us regarding cognition in addition to our classically poor understanding of the functional and structural neuroanatomy underlying complex higher-order cognitive functions. Furthermore, reduction of the brain into isolated cortical regions without consideration of the complex, interacting brain networks which these regions function within to subserve higher-order cognition inherently prevents our successful navigation of true eloquent and non-eloquent cerebrum. Fortunately, recent large-scale movements in the neuroscience community, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), have provided updated neural data detailing the many intricate macroscopic connections between cortical regions which integrate and process the information underlying complex human behavior within a brain “connectome.” Connectomic data can provide us better maps on how to understand convoluted cortical and subcortical relationships between tumor and human cerebrum such that neurosurgeons can begin to make more informed decisions during surgery to maximize the onco-functional balance. However, connectome-based neurosurgery and related applications for neurorehabilitation are relatively nascent and require further work moving forward to optimize our ability to add highly valuable connectomic data to our surgical armamentarium. In this manuscript, we review four concepts with detailed examples which will help us better understand post-operative cognitive outcomes and provide a guide for how to utilize connectomics to reduce cognitive morbidity following cerebral surgery.},

Current commercial interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are capable of performing anatomical and diffusion weighted imaging and are used for guidance during various neurosurgical procedures. We present an interventional imaging workflow that can accurately localize the optic radiation during surgery. The workflow is driven by a near real-time multichannel nonrigid image registration algorithm that uses both anatomical and fractional anisotropy pre- and intra-operative images. The proposed workflow is implemented on graphical processing units and we perform a warping of the pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation to the intra-operative space in under 3 min making the proposed algorithm suitable for use under the stringent time constraints of neurosurgical procedures. The method was validated using both a numerical phantom and clinical data using pre- and post-operative images from patients who had undergone surgery for treatment of refractory focal epilepsy and shows strong correlation between the observed post-operative visual field deficit and the predicted damage to the optic radiation. We also validate the algorithm using interventional MRI datasets from a small cohort of patients. This work could be of significant utility in image guided interventions and facilitate effective surgical treatments.},

  abstract = {We report our preliminary series of patients treated for lesions involving the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract in BrainSuite, with intraoperative MRI, tractography and neuronavigated electrophysiological cortical and subcortical mapping. An exact localization of the cortical and subcortical functional areas is mandatory for executing surgery of intra-parenchymal neoplasm involving the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract. Nowadays modern technology offers a variety of tools to reduce as much as possible postoperative deficits during surgery of cerebral eloquent areas. From December 2008 and June 2010, 18 patients underwent functional surgery, for neoplasm involving the motor cortex and/or the subcortical pathway, in BrainSuite. Our preliminary series include 14 gliomas and 4 metastases; Table 1 summarizes all of the data. We included in this series patients with complete removal of lesions of eloquent areas with an average distance from the corticospinal tract of 4 mm. Six neoplasms were considered in contact and/or involving the motor cortex, while in 18 cases (100\%) the tumour involved eloquent areas concerning the corticospinal tract. All of the patients underwent complete removal of the lesion as subsequently demonstrated by intraoperative postsurgical MRI. Our series highlights the good integration and the high compatibility between BrainSUITE with 1.5 T intraoperative magnetic field and neurophysiological monitoring. We strongly believe that intraoperative MRI with DTI allows us to treat complex surgery tumours that without its auxilium we would not be able to deal with. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

  abstract = {Objective Language dysfunction, visual deficit, numeracy impairment, and Gerstmann syndrome often occur in the cortical area; furthermore, the subcortical white matter is the inviolable limit of "functional neurosurgery." Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tractography are capable of providing the data required for safe "surgical planning" at both the cortical and subcortical levels. Methods We report our experience regarding high-grade gliomas affecting the dominant angular gyrus (AG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and their respective subcortical areas using intraoperative MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Retrospectively, we reviewed a consecutive series of 27 patients operated in a BrainSuite for high-grade intraparenchymal tumors of the left posterior temporoparietal junction. We included tumors involving the dominant AG, SMG, and/or IPS and the subcortical course of arcuate fasciculus (AF) and all the patients who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI to localize the AF and the eloquent cortical areas. Just after craniotomy, new volumetric MRI and DTI verified and corrected possible brain shift. After the gross total resection was carried out, and before approaching the residual mass close to the white matter tract, an intraoperative MRI was again performed. Results We operated on 27 patients, 15 males and 12 females, whose diagnosis was always high-grade glioma. During the preoperative neurologic examination, 6 patients were asymptomatic; 3 presented a Gerstmann syndrome; 16 showed dysphasic disturbances, 6 of which were associated with visual field deficits; and 2 showed weakness of the right limb. Conclusions Our results suggest that this approach is completely safe and effective as an alternative to awake surgery.},

We addressed this question via systematic review of the literature.EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried. Case studies, reviews or editorials, non-English, abstract-only, brain metastases, and descriptive works were excluded. All others were included.Three hundred and nine unique references yielded 41 studies for full-text review, with 7 included in the final analysis. Studies were mostly of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Level 4 quality. A total of 88 patients underwent supratotal resection in a combined cohort of 492 patients (214 males and 278 females, age 18 to 82 years). Fifty-one supratotal resections were conducted on high-grade gliomas, and 37 on low-grade gliomas. Karnofsky performance status, overall survival, progression-free survival, neurological deficits postoperatively, and anaplastic transformation were the main measured outcomes. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Preliminary low-quality support was found for supratotal resection in increasing overall survival and progression-free survival for both low-grade and high-grade glioma.The literature suggests insufficient evidence for carte blanche application of supratotal resection, particularly in lower-grade gliomas where neurological deficits can result in long-term disability. While the preliminary studies discussed here, containing data from only a few centers, have reported increased progression-free and overall survival, these claims require validation in prospective research studies involving larger patient populations with clearly defined appropriate outcome metrics in order to reduce potential bias.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has improved pre-planning of surgery in eloquent cortical areas, but remains unable to map white matter. Thus, tumour resection in functional subcortical regions still presents a high risk of sequelae. The authors successfully used intraoperative electrical stimulations to perform subcortical language pathway mapping in order to avoid postoperative de®nitive de®cit, and correlated these functional ®nd-ings with the anatomical location of the eloquent bundles detected using postoperative MRI. At the same time, this also improved knowledge of ®bre connectivity. Thirty patients harbouring a cortico-subcortical low-grade glioma in the left dominant hemisphere were operated on whilst awake using intraoperative electrical functional mapping during surgical resection. Language cortical sites and subcortical pathways were clearly identi®ed and preserved in the 30 cases. The anatomo-functional correlations between data obtained using intraoperative subcortical mapping and postoperative MRI revealed the existence in all patients of common pathways which seem essential to language. This was shown by inducing reproducible speech disturbances during stimulations as follows: the subcallosal fasciculus (initiation disorders), the periventricular white matter (dysarthria), the arcuate fasciculus and the insular connections (anomia). Clinically, all patients except three presented a transient postoperative dysphasia, which resolved within 3 months. On control MRI, 14 resec-tions were total and 16 subtotal due to in®ltration of functional bundles described above. It is recommended that the combination of the techniques as described could prove ideal for future non-invasive reliable sub-cortical mapping both in healthy volunteers and in patients harbouring a (cortico)subcortical lesion in order to optimize surgical pre-planning.

Second, I discuss the contribution of new techniques, such as functional mapping, to our understanding of brain reorganisation in response to progressive growth of LGG.

In particular, I show how longitudinal studies (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) could allow us to optimise the surgical risk-to-benefit ratios. I will also discuss controversial issues such as defining surgical indications for LGGs, predicting the risk of postoperative deficit, aspects of operative surgical neuro-oncology (eg, preoperative planning and preservation of functional areas and tracts), and postoperative functional recovery.},

  abstract = {Background Surgical resection of high-grade gliomas (HGG) is standard therapy because it imparts significant progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, HGG-tumor margins are indistinguishable from normal brain during surgery. Hence intraoperative technology such as fluorescence (ALA, fluorescein) and intraoperative ultrasound (IoUS) and MRI (IoMRI) has been deployed. This study compares the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies. Methods Critical literature review and meta-analyses, using MEDLINE/PubMed service. The list of references in each article was double-checked for any missing references. We included all studies that reported the use of ALA, fluorescein (FLCN), IoUS or IoMRI to guide HGG-surgery. The meta-analyses were conducted according to statistical heterogeneity between studies. If there was no heterogeneity, fixed effects model was used; otherwise, a random effects model was used. Statistical heterogeneity was explored by χ2 and inconsistency (I2) statistics. To assess cost-effectiveness, we calculated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results Gross total resection (GTR) after ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI was 69.1\%, 84.4\%, 73.4\% and 70\% respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. All four techniques led to significant prolongation of PFS and tended to prolong OS. However none of these technologies led to significant prolongation of OS compared to controls. The cost/QALY was \$16,218, \$3181, \$6049 and \$32,954 for ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI respectively. Conclusions ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI significantly improve GTR and PFS of HGG. Their incremental cost was below the threshold for cost-effectiveness of HGG-therapy, denoting that each intraoperative technology was cost-effective on its own.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Preoperative magnetic resonance images (pMR) are typically coregistered to provide intraoperative navigation, the accuracy of which can be significantly compromised by brain deformation. In this study, the authors generated updated MR images (uMR) in the operating room (OR) to compensate for brain shift due to dural opening, and evaluated the accuracy and computational efficiency of the process. METHODS In 20 open cranial neurosurgical cases, a pair of intraoperative stereovision (iSV) images was acquired after dural opening to reconstruct a 3D profile of the exposed cortical surface. The iSV surface was registered with pMR to detect cortical displacements that were assimilated by a biomechanical model to estimate whole-brain nonrigid deformation and produce uMR in the OR. The uMR views were displayed on a commercial navigation system and compared side by side with the corresponding coregistered pMR. A tracked stylus was used to acquire coordinate locations of features on the cortical surface that served as independent positions for calculating target registration errors (TREs) for the coregistered uMR and pMR image volumes. RESULTS The uMR views were visually more accurate and well aligned with the iSV surface in terms of both geometry and texture compared with pMR where misalignment was evident. The average misfit between model estimates and measured displacements was 1.80 ± 0.35 mm, compared with the average initial misfit of 7.10 ± 2.78 mm between iSV and pMR, and the average TRE was 1.60 ± 0.43 mm across the 20 patients in the uMR image volume, compared with 7.31 ± 2.82 mm on average in the pMR cases. The iSV also proved to be accurate with an average error of 1.20 ± 0.37 mm. The overall computational time required to generate the uMR views was 7-8 minutes. CONCLUSIONS This study compensated for brain deformation caused by intraoperative dural opening using computational model-based assimilation of iSV cortical surface displacements. The uMR proved to be more accurate in terms of model-data misfit and TRE in the 20 patient cases evaluated relative to pMR. The computational time was acceptable (7-8 minutes) and the process caused minimal interruption of surgical workflow.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravoxel incoherent motion MRI has been proposed as an alternative method to measure brain perfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters (the perfusion fraction, the pseudodiffusion coefficient, and the flow-related parameter) to differentiate high- and low-grade brain gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were assessed in 21 brain gliomas (16 high-grade, 5 low-grade). Images were acquired by using a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion pulse sequence, with 16 values of b (0-900 s/mm 2) in 3 orthogonal directions on 3T systems equipped with 32 multichannel receiver head coils. The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were derived by fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion biexponential model. Regions of interest were drawn in regions of maximum intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and contralateral control regions. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student t test. In addition, regions of interest were drawn around all whole tumors and were evaluated with the help of histograms. RESULTS: In the regions of maximum perfusion fraction, perfusion fraction was significantly higher in the high-grade group (0.127±0.031) than in the low-grade group (0.084 ± 0.016, P {$<$} .001) and in the contralateral control region (0.061 ± 0.011, P {$<$} .001). No statistically significant difference was observed for the pseudodiffusion coefficient. The perfusion fraction correlated moderately with dynamic susceptibility contrast relative CBV (r=0.59). The histograms of the perfusion fraction showed a "heavy-tailed" distribution for high-grade but not low-grade gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction is helpful for differentiating high- from low-grade brain gliomas.},

  abstract = {Background The temporal lobe is an important and complex anatomic region of the brain. Accurate knowledge of anatomic relationships becomes extremely relevant when deciding surgical strategy, such as epilepsy or oncologic surgery, involving this lobe. To our knowledge, there is no strong literature highlighting the relationship between white matter tracts and craniometric landmarks applied to temporal lobe surgery. We aim to describe the topographic relationship between the craniometric points and white matter tracts of the temporal lobe through dissection of cadaveric specimens and describe the potential preoperative usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging in relation to the anatomic features found during the dissections. Methods Fifteen formalin-fixed whole cadaveric heads were dissected by the Klingler technique in a stepwise manner across the temporal and sphenoid bone windows. The white matter pathways were identified in their different planes and their position was described in relation to craniometric landmarks. Diffusion tensor studies were performed in 2 healthy volunteers to analyze the temporal fasciculi in~vivo. Results We identified the topographic relationships between craniometric points and relevant association tracts that lie within the cranial corridors (superior and inferior frontal, parietal, occipital, sphenoidal, and temporal). Important landmarks were defined in correspondence to these different fasciculi. Conclusions Through this kind of microsurgical anatomic study, a better understanding of the different anatomic layers of the temporal region might be achieved. This factor is essential in planning adequate surgery and strategies to operate in the temporal lobe, improving surgical results and minimizing functional deficits.},

  abstract = {Purpose Brain shift during tumor resection can progressively invalidate the accuracy of neuronavigation systems and affect neurosurgeons' ability to achieve optimal resections. This paper compares two methods that have been presented in the literature to compensate for brain shift: a thin-plate spline deformation model and a finite element method (FEM). For this comparison, both methods are driven by identical sparse data. Specifically, both methods are driven by displacements between automatically detected and matched feature points from intraoperative 3D ultrasound (iUS). Both methods have been shown to be fast enough for intraoperative brain shift correction (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018; Luo et al. in J Med Imaging (Bellingham) 4(3):035003, 2017). However, the spline method requires no preprocessing and ignores physical properties of the brain while the FEM method requires significant preprocessing and incorporates patient-specific physical and geometric constraints. The goal of this work was to explore the relative merits of these methods on recent clinical data. Methods Data acquired during 19 sequential tumor resections in Brigham and Women's Hospital's Advanced Multi-modal Image-Guided Operating Suite between December 2017 and October 2018 were considered for this retrospective study. Of these, 15 cases and a total of 24 iUS to iUS image pairs met inclusion requirements. Automatic feature detection (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018) was used to detect and match features in each pair of iUS images. Displacements between matched features were then used to drive both the spline model and the FEM method to compensate for brain shift between image acquisitions. The accuracies of the resultant deformation models were measured by comparing the displacements of manually identified landmarks before and after deformation. Results The mean initial subcortical registration error between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image averaged 5.3 ± 0.75 mm. The mean subcortical brain shift, measured using displacements between manually identified landmarks in pairs of iUS images, was 2.5 ± 1.3 mm. Our results showed that FEM was able to reduce subcortical registration error by a small but statistically significant amount (from 2.46 to 2.02 mm). A large variability in the results of the spline method prevented us from demonstrating either a statistically significant reduction in subcortical registration error after applying the spline method or a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods. Conclusions In this study, we observed less subcortical brain shift than has previously been reported in the literature (Frisken et al., in: Miller (ed) Biomechanics of the brain, Springer, Cham, 2019). This may be due to the fact that we separated out the initial misregistration between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image from our brain shift measurements or it may be due to modern neurosurgical practices designed to reduce brain shift, including reduced craniotomy sizes and better control of intracranial pressure with the use of mannitol and other medications. It appears that the FEM method and its use of geometric and biomechanical constraints provided more consistent brain shift correction and better correction farther from the driving feature displacements than the simple spline model. The spline-based method was simpler and tended to give better results for small deformations. However, large variability in the spline results and relatively small brain shift prevented this study from demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods.},

Awake craniotomy with cortical mapping and electrical stimulation along with other preoperative and intraoperative surgical adjuncts, including intraoperative magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging, facilitates maximization of resection and eschews precipitating neurological deficits. Intraoperative imaging permits additional resection of identified residual to be completed within the same surgical session, improving extent of resection and consequently progression free and overall survival.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Neuronavigation based on preoperative imaging data is a ubiquitous tool for image guidance in neurosurgery. However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration. Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift. METHODS: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring due to physical, surgical or biological factors. RESULTS: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention. The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful. CONCLUSION: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors trace the history of cranial temporary resection, described by Wilhelm Wagner (1848–1900) in 1889, which changed the paradigm of the cranial opening from trephining to the craniotomy. The objective of the temporary resection was to obtain wide openings in the skull, keeping the cranial flap attached to the soft tissues to maintain bone vitality. The cranial temporary resection was reproduced by the authors in an anatomical study faithfully following the original technique, demonstrating the feasibility of the surgical procedure as described by Wagner. Surgical steps include a large omega-shaped skin incision and a beveled cut of the bone with the chisel and mallet until reaching the dura mater, lifting the bone flap en bloc along with all superficial soft tissues. A literature review shows that the temporary cranial resection became a great success at that time because it allowed physicians to improve a number of constraints of the cranial opening using the crown trephine: bone vitality; a wide cranial window; easy, safe, and quick surgery; and economy of surgical instruments. The crude, primitive proposal of the temporary resection was ameliorated to quickly build the successful model of the modern craniotomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coexisting complex visual field defects and serious ophthalmologic comorbidities make the management of the pituitary macroadenomas more challenging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic resonance imaging that tracks neural fibers in the white matter has been used recently to visualize the impact of different pathologies on cranial nerves. This study explains application of anterior optic pathway tractography for patients with ophthalmologic comorbidities and pituitary adenoma. METHODS: Two patients with atypical visual field defects caused by nonfunctional pituitary macroadenoma and simultaneous ophthalmologic morbidities (one glaucoma and the other giant cell arteritis) were selected for surgical decompression of the anterior optic apparatus. Standard perimetry and optic pathway DTI were done preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: The nontypical pattern of visual field defect could not differentiate between the ophthalmologic disease and the chiasmatic compression attributable to pituitary macroadenoma as the main cause. Preoperative visual pathway DTI tractography showed lack of decussating chiasmatic fibers in both of the patients. DTI tractography revealed the reappearance of these fibers intraoperatively in one and postoperatively in the other one. Three months after surgery, the visual field and acuity improved and DTI tractography confirmed presence of crossing chiasmatic fibers. CONCLUSION: Visual pathway DTI tractography is a promising adjunct to the standard perimetry in preoperative assessment of pituitary macroadenoma with serious ophthalmologic comorbidities. It also may be useful in the intraoperative determination of the optic pathway decompression and for following the visual outcome of these patients after surgery. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to compare gross total resection (GTR) with subtotal resection (STR) for treatment effects in elderly patients with high-grade glioma. Methods: Three electronic databases were systematically searched, including PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane library, from inception to August 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to express summary effect estimates using the random-effects model. Nineteen retrospective observational studies involving a total of 10,815 elderly patients with high-grade glioma were included in this meta-analysis. Results: The summary results indicated that GTR was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with STR (HR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.64-0.77). In addition, elderly patients administered GTR showed lower risk of 3-month mortality (OR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.24-0.93), 6-month mortality (OR = 0.38, 95\% CI = 0.26-0.56), 9-month mortality (OR = 0.35, 95\% CI = 0.25-0.49), and 1-year mortality (OR = 0.40, 95\% CI = 0.29-0.56). Pooled OS data differed when stratified by publication year, country, sample size, disease status, and study quality. Conclusion: GTR seems to be more effective than STR in achieving longer survival in elderly patients with high-grade glioma.},

  abstract = {The neural foundations underlying semantic processing have been extensively investigated, highlighting a pivotal role of the ventral stream. However, although studies concerning the involvement of the left ventral route in verbal semantics are proficient, the potential implication of the right ventral pathway in non-verbal semantics has been to date unexplored. To gain insights on this matter, we used an intraoperative direct electrostimulation to map the structures mediating the non-verbal semantic system in the right hemisphere. Thirteen patients presenting with a right low-grade glioma located within or close to the ventral stream were included. During the ‘awake’ procedure, patients performed both a visual non-verbal semantic task and a verbal (control) task. At the cortical level, in the right hemisphere, we found non-verbal semantic-related sites (n~=~7 in 6 patients) in structures commonly associated with verbal semantic processes in the left hemisphere, including the superior temporal gyrus, the pars triangularis, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. At the subcortical level, we found non-verbal semantic-related sites in all but one patient (n~=~15 sites in 12 patients). Importantly, all these responsive stimulation points were located on the spatial course of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). These findings provide direct support for a critical role of the right IFOF in non-verbal semantic processing. Based upon these original data, and in connection with previous findings showing the involvement of the left IFOF in non-verbal semantic processing, we hypothesize the existence of a bilateral network underpinning the non-verbal semantic system, with a homotopic connectional architecture.},

  abstract = {Stereovision is an important intraoperative imaging technique that captures the exposed parenchymal surface noninvasively during open cranial surgery. Estimating cortical surface shift efficiently and accurately is critical to compensate for brain deformation in the operating room (OR). In this study, we present an automatic and robust registration technique based on optical flow (OF) motion tracking to compensate for cortical surface displacement throughout surgery. Stereo images of the cortical surface were acquired at multiple time points after dural opening to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) texture intensity-encoded cortical surfaces. A local coordinate system was established with its z-axis parallel to the average surface normal direction of the reconstructed cortical surface immediately after dural opening in order to produce two-dimensional (2D) projection images. A dense displacement field between the two projection images was determined directly from OF motion tracking without the need for feature identification or tracking. The starting and end points of the displacement vectors on the two cortical surfaces were then obtained following spatial mapping inversion to produce the full 3D displacement of the exposed cortical surface. We evaluated the technique with images obtained from digital phantoms and 18 surgical cases - 10 of which involved independent measurements of feature locations acquired with a tracked stylus for accuracy comparisons, and 8 others of which 4 involved stereo image acquisitions at three or more time points during surgery to illustrate utility throughout a procedure. Results from the digital phantom images were very accurate (0.05. pixels). In the 10 surgical cases with independently digitized point locations, the average agreement between feature coordinates derived from the cortical surface reconstructions was 1.7-2.1. mm relative to those determined with the tracked stylus probe. The agreement in feature displacement tracking was also comparable to tracked probe data (difference in displacement magnitude was {$<$}1. mm on average). The average magnitude of cortical surface displacement was 7.9 ± 5.7. mm (range 0.3-24.4. mm) in all patient cases with the displacement components along gravity being 5.2 ± 6.0. mm relative to the lateral movement of 2.4 ± 1.6. mm. Thus, our technique appears to be sufficiently accurate and computationally efficiency (typically \textasciitilde 15. s), for applications in the OR. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of intraoperative MRI (iMRI) during treatment of gliomas may increase extent of resection (EOR), decrease need for early reoperation, and increase progression-free and overall survival, but has not been fully validated, particularly in the pediatric population. Objective: To assess the accuracy of iMRI to identify residual tumor in pediatric patients with glioma and determine the effect of iMRI on decisions for resection, complication rates, and other outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a multicenter database of pediatric patients (age ≤ 18~years) who underwent resection of pathologically confirmed gliomas. Results: We identified 314 patients (mean age 9.7 ± 4.6~years) with mean follow-up of 48.3 ± 33.6~months (range 0.03–182.07~months) who underwent surgery with iMRI. There were 201 (64.0\%) WHO grade I tumors, 57 (18.2\%) grade II, 24 (7.6\%) grade III, 9 (2.9\%) grade IV, and 23 (7.3\%) not classified. Among 280 patients who underwent resection using iMRI, 131 (46.8\%) had some residual tumor and underwent additional resection after the first iMRI. Of the 33 tissue specimens sent for pathological analysis after iMRI, 29 (87.9\%) showed positive tumor pathology. Gross total resection was identified in 156 patients (55.7\%), but this was limited by 69 (24.6\%) patients with unknown EOR. Conclusions: Analysis of the largest multicenter database of pediatric gliomas resected using iMRI demonstrated additional tumor resection in a substantial portion of cases. However, determining the impact of iMRI on EOR and outcomes remains challenging because iMRI use varies among providers nationally. Continued refinement of iMRI techniques for use in pediatric patients with glioma may improve outcomes.},

Histological diagnosis and extent of tumor resection had been confirmed by central neuropathological review and post-surgical imaging. The extent of tumor resection represented the most prominent prognostic factor for overall (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in univariate and Cox regression analyses. Four-year survival after gross total tumor resection was 48.0±12.0\% (OS) and 14.1±8.9\% (EFS), after non-total resection 13.2±6.1\% and 2.9±2.8\%, respectively. From several clinical parameters, only histological grading displayed a similar statistical significance in Cox regression analysis. In conclusion, gross total tumor resection improves survival in pediatric patients with malignant gliomas and should always be attempted when possible.},

Most of the studies included descriptive statistics of patient populations of mixed pathology, and iMRI systems of varying field strengths between 0·15 and 1·5 Tesla. Most studies provided information on EOTR, but did not always mention how iMRI affected the surgical strategy. Only a few studies included information on quality of life or survival for subpopulations with glioblastoma multiforme or high-grade glioma. Several limitations and sources of bias were apparent, which affected the conclusions drawn and might have led to overestimation of the added value of iMRI-guided surgery for resection of glioblastoma multiforme. Based on the available literature, there is, at best, level 2 evidence that iMRI-guided surgery is more effective than conventional neuronavigation-guided surgery in increasing EOTR, enhancing quality of life, or prolonging survival after resection of glioblastoma multiforme. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objective:Up to now, fiber tractography in the clinical routine is mostly based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are known drawbacks in the resolution of crossing or kissing fibers and in the vicinity of a tumor or edema. These restrictions can be overcome by tractography based on High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) which in turn requires larger numbers of gradients resulting in longer acquisition times. Using compressed sensing (CS) techniques, HARDI signals can be obtained by using less non-collinear diffusion gradients, thus enabling the use of HARDI-based fiber tractography in the clinical routine.Methods:Eight patients with gliomas in the temporal lobe, in proximity to the optic radiation (OR), underwent 3T MRI including a diffusion-weighted dataset with 30 gradient directions. Fiber tractography of the OR using a deterministic streamline algorithm based on DTI was compared to tractography based on reconstructed diffusion signals using HARDI+CS.Results:HARDI+CS based tractography displayed the OR more conclusively compared to the DTI-based results in all eight cases. In particular, the potential of HARDI+CS-based tractography was observed for cases of high grade gliomas with significant peritumoral edema, larger tumor size or closer proximity of tumor and reconstructed fiber tract.Conclusions:Overcoming the problem of long acquisition times, HARDI+CS seems to be a promising basis for fiber tractography of the OR in regions of disturbed diffusion, areas of high interest in glioma surgery. © 2013 Kuhnt et al.},

  abstract = {Background. Awake craniotomy is a useful surgical approach to identify and preserve eloquent areas during tumour resection, during surgery for arteriovenous malformation resections and for resective epilepsy surgery. With decreasing age, a child’s ability to cooperate and mange an awake craniotomy becomes increasingly relevant. Preoperative screening is essential to identify the child who can undergo the procedure safely. Case Description. A 11-year-old female patient presented with a tumour in her right motor cortex, presumed to be a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET). We had concerns regarding the feasibility of performing awake surgery in this patient as psychological testing revealed easy distractibility and an inability to follow commands repetitively. We devised a simulated surgical experience to assess her ability to manage such a procedure. During the simulated theatre experience, attempts were made to replicate the actual theatre experience as closely as possible. The patient was dressed in theatre attire and brought into the theatre on a theatre trolley. She was then transferred onto the theatre bed and positioned in the same manner as she would be for the actual surgery. Her head was placed on a horseshoe headrest, and she was made to lie in a semilateral position, as required for the surgery. A blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, nasal cannula with oxygen flow, and calf pumps were applied. She was then draped precisely as she would have been for the procedure. Theatre lighting was set as it would be for the surgical case. The application of the monitoring devices, nasal cannula, and draping was meant not only to prepare her for the procedure but to induce a mild degree of stress such that we could assess the child’s coping skills and ability to undergo the procedure. The child performed well throughout the simulated run, and surgery was thus offered. An asleep-awake-asleep technique was planned and employed for surgical removal of the tumour. Cortical and subcortical mapping was used to identify the eloquent tissue. Throughout the procedure, the child was cooperative and anxiety free. Follow-up MRI revealed gross total removal of the lesion. Conclusion. A simulated theatre experience allowed us to accurately determine that this young patient, despite relative contraindications, was indeed eligible for awake surgery. We will continue to use this technique for all our young patients in assessing their eligibility for these procedures.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The posterior fossa in a child poses a considerable challenge to the neurosurgeon. MRI-guided surgery allows for real time interaction between imaging and the neurosurgeon, not permitted by frameless stereotaxy, and with higher resolution than ultrasound or CT. Materials and Methods: The University of Minnesota 1.5 T Phillips interventional MRI was used. From 1997 to 2000, nine posterior fossa intraoperative magnet cases out of eleven were pediatric. The mean age was 6.4 years and the median age 7. Seven midline craniotomies were performed, of which three were re-operations. Two were burr hole placements, one for cyst aspiration and P32 instillation, and the other for tumor biopsy. Results: Two tumors were predominantly in the fourth ventricle, four in the cerebellum, two in the brainstem, and one in the prepontine cystern. Four tumors were juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, two were anaplastic astrocytomas, and one each was ependymoma, craniopharyngioma cyst, and medulloblastoma. Four patients had complete radiologic resection. Two had maximal resections limited by vital structures. P32 instillation and tumor biopsy were done in a single pass. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 1.4 years. The cyst that was aspirated and had P32 instillation remains absent. The two mortalities were in the patients with medulloblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. There were no intra-operative mortalities. The other patient with anaplastic astrocytoma progressed. The remainder had stable imaging. Conclusion: MRI-guided surgery results in improved resection imaging and real-time needle guidance in tumor operations. Its value could lie in low-grade lesions, where maximal resection is most beneficial. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract = {Object. Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging tractography is increasingly used to map fiber tracts in patients with surgical brain lesions to reduce the risk of postoperative functional deficit. There are few validation studies of DT imaging tractography in these patients. The aim of this study was to compare DT imaging tractography of language fiber tracts by using intraoperative subcortical electrical stimulations. Methods. The authors included 10 patients with low-grade gliomas or dysplasia located in language areas. The MR imaging examination included 3D T1-weighted images for anatomical coregistration, FLAIR, and DT images. Diffusion tensors and fiber tracts were calculated using in-house software. Four tracts were reconstructed in each patient including the arcuate fasciculus, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and 2 premotor fasciculi (the subcallosal medialis fiber tract and cortical fibers originating from the medial and lateral premotor areas). The authors compared fiber tracts reconstructed using DT imaging with those evidenced using intraoperative subcortical language mapping. Results. Seventeen (81\%) of 21 positive stimulations were concordant with DT imaging fiber bundles (located within 6 mm of a fiber tract). Four positive stimulations were not located in the vicinity of a DT imaging fiber tract. Stimulations of the arcuate fasciculus mostly induced articulatory and phonemic/syntactic disorders and less frequently semantic paraphasias. Stimulations of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus induced semantic paraphasias. Stimulations of the premotor-related fasciculi induced dysarthria and articulatory planning deficit. Conclusions. There was a good correspondence between positive stimulation sites and fiber tracts, suggesting that DT imaging fiber tracking is a reliable technique but not yet optimal to map language tracts in patients with brain lesions. Negative tractography does not rule out the persistence of a fiber tract, especially when invaded by the tumor. Stimulations of the different tracts induced variable language disorders that were specific to each fiber tract.},

  abstract = {Background: Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) has been recognized as a useful adjunct for brain tumor surgery in pediatric patients. There is minimal data on the use of an offsite intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging operating theater (iMRI OT), whereby vehicle transfer of patients is involved. The primary aim of this study is to validate the feasibility of perioperative patient transfer to use an offsite iMRI OT for patients with pediatric brain tumor. Secondary objectives include the assessment of tumor resection efficacy and perioperative outcomes in our patient cohort. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-institution clinical study of prospectively collected data from Singapore's largest children hospital. Variables of interest include issues encountered during interhospital transfer, achievement of surgical aims, length of stay in hospital, and postoperative complications. Our findings were compared with results of related studies published in the literature. Results: From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018, a total of 35 pediatric operative cases were performed in our offsite iMRI OT. Within this cohort, 24 of these were brain tumor surgery cases. For all the patients in this study, use of the iMRI OT influenced intraoperative decisions. Average ambulance transport time from parent hospital to the iMRI OT was 30.5 minutes, and from iMRI OT back to the parent hospital after surgery was 27.7 minutes. The average length of hospitalization stay was 7.9 days per patient. There were no ferromagnetic accidents during perioperative iMRI scanning and no airway/hemodynamic incidents in patients encountered during interhospital transfer. Conclusions: In our local context, the use of interhospital transfers for access to iMRI OT is a safe and feasible option in ensuring good patient outcomes for a select group of patients with pediatric brain tumors.},

  abstract = {© 2019 SPIE. Brai\#resn shift during neurosurgery can compromise the fidelity of image guidance and potentially lead to surgical error. We have developed a finite element model-based brain shift compensation strategy to correct preoperative images for improved intraoperative navigation. This workflow-friendly approach precomputes potential intraoperative deformations (a â€ deformation atlas') via a biphasic-biomechanical-model accounting for brain deformation associated with cerebrospinal fluid drainage, osmotic agents, resection, and swelling. Intraoperatively, an inverse problem approach is employed to provide a combinatory fit from the atlas that best matches sparse intraoperative measurements. Subsequently, preoperative image is deformed accordingly to better reflect patient's intraoperative anatomy. While we have performed several retrospective studies examining model's accuracy using post-or intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging, one challenging task is to examine model's ability to recapture shift due to the aforementioned effects independently with clinical data and in a longitudinal manner under varying conditions. The work here is a case study where swelling was observed at the initial stage of surgery (after craniotomy and dura opening), subsequently sag was observed in a later stage of resection. Intraoperative tissue swelling and sag were captured via an optically tracked stylus by identifying cortical surface vessel features (n = 9), and model-based correction was performed for these two distinct types of brain shift at different stages of the procedure. Within the course of the entire surgery, we estimate the cortical surface experienced a deformation trajectory absolute path length of approximately 19.4 ± 2.1 mm reflecting swelling followed by sag. Overall, model reduced swelling-induced shift from 7.3 ± 1.1 to 1.8 ± 0.5 mm (∼74.6\% correction); for subsequent sag movement, model reduced shift from 6.4 ± 1.5 to 1.4 ± 0.5 mm (∼76.6\% correction).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The aim of this scoping review was to identify relevant articles that have contributed to the body of knowledge describing pediatric neurosurgical healthcare disparities. Identifying healthcare disparities in pediatric neurosurgery is essential to understanding how to best provide care for this unique patient population. Although it is undoubtedly important to increase the knowledge of pediatric neurosurgical healthcare disparities, it is also important to understand the current state of the literature.                                         METHODS               This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The search terms "pediatric neurosurgical disparities" and "pediatric neurosurgical inequities" were entered into the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase.                                         RESULTS               The initial database search returned a total of 366 results from the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. One hundred thirty-seven duplicates were removed, and the remaining articles were screened by title and abstract. Articles were excluded on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the remaining 229 articles, 168 were excluded. Sixty-one full-text articles were then examined for eligibility, and 28 did not reach the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining 33 articles were included for final review. The results of the reviewed studies were stratified on the basis of disparity type.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Although there has been an increase in the number of publications discussing pediatric neurosurgical healthcare disparities within the last decade, there still remains a scarcity of information regarding healthcare disparities in neurosurgery. Furthermore, less information exists that specifically addresses healthcare disparities in the pediatric population.},

  abstract = {Background Our goal is to indicate the importance of combining intraoperative tractography with motor-evoked potential (MEP) monitoring for glioma surgery in motor eloquent areas. Methods Tumor removal was performed in 28 patients with gliomas in and around the corticospinal tract (CST), in an operation theater equipped with an integrated high-field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and a neuronavigation system. Diffusion-tensor imaging-based tractography of the CST was implemented preoperatively and intraoperatively. When the surgically manipulated area came close to the corticospinal pathway, MEP responses were elicited by subcortical stimulation. Responsive areas were compared with the locations of fibers traced by preoperative and intraoperative tractography. Imaging and functional outcomes were reviewed. Results Intraoperative tractography demonstrated significant inward or outward shift during surgery. MEP responses were observed around the tract at various intensities, and the distance between MEP responsive sites and intraoperative tractography was significantly correlated with the stimulation intensity (P {$<$} 0.01). The distance from preoperative tractography was not correlated. A more than subtotal resection was achieved in 24 patients (85.7\%). Transient motor deterioration was seen in 12 patients (42.8\%), and a permanent deficit was seen in 1 patient (3.5\%). Conclusions We found that intraoperative tractography demonstrated the location of the CST more accurately than preoperative tractography. The results of the linear regression between distance and stimulation intensity were informative for guiding approaches to tumor remnants without impinging on the CST. The combination of intraoperative tractography and MEP monitoring can enhance the quality of surgery for gliomas in motor eloquent areas. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, DTI is not a routine procedure for preoperative planning for brain tumor resection. Our study aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of DTI and the outcomes of surgery. The electronic databases, PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus, were searched for relevant studies. Studies were systematically reviewed based on the application of DTI in pre-surgical planning, modification of operative planning, re-evaluation of preoperative DTI data intraoperatively, and the outcome of surgery decisions. Seventeen studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies agreed that preoperative planning using DTI improves postoperative neuro-deficits, giving a greater resection yield and shortening the surgery time. The results also indicate that the re-evaluation of preoperative DTI intraoperatively assists in a better visualization of white matter tract shifts. Seven studies also suggested that DTI modified the surgical decision of the initial surgical approach and the rate of the GTR in tumor resection surgery. The utilization of DTI may give essential information on white matter tract pathways, for a better surgical approach, and eventually reduce the risk of neurologic deficits after surgery.},

OBJECTIVE: To identify these factors in the pediatric population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed institutional databases evaluating all patients ≤21 years with high-grade glioma treated between 1988 and 2010. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank statistics were used to compare groups univariately. Multivariate analyses were completed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were identified with a median age of 11 years. Median OS was 1.7 years, and median PFS was 272 days. Location was significant for OS (P {$<$}.001). Patients with gross total resection (GTR) had a median OS of 3.4 years vs 1.6 years for subtotal resection and 1.3 years for biopsy patients (P {$<$}.001). Female patients had improved OS (P .01). Female patients with GTR had a mean OS of 8.1 years vs 2.4 years for male patients with GTR and 1.4 years for all other female patients and male patients (P .001). PFS favored patients ≤3 and ≥13 years and females (P .003 and.001). CONCLUSION: OS was significantly correlated with the location of the tumor and the extent of resection. GTR significantly improved overall survival for both glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma patients, and female patients showed a much larger survival benefit from GTR than male patients.

In addition to established use in surgical and medical training, VR/AR are gaining traction for clinical use preoperatively and intraoperatively. To understand the utility of VR/AR in the clinical setting, we conducted a literature search in Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE with various search terms designed to capture the use of VR/AR in neurosurgical procedures for resection of cranial tumors. The search retrieved 302 articles, of which 35 were subjected to full-text review; 19 full-text articles were included in the review. Key findings highlighted by the individual authors were extracted and summarized into themes to present the value of VR/AR in the clinical setting. These studies included various VR/AR systems applied to surgeries involving heterogeneous pathologies and outcome measures. Overall, VR/AR were found to be qualitatively advantageous due to enhanced visualization of complex anatomy and improved intraoperative lesion localization. When these technologies were compared with existing neuronavigation systems, quantitative clinical benefits were also reported. The capacity to visualize three-dimensional images superimposed on patient anatomy is a potentially valuable tool in complex neurosurgical environments. Surgical limitations may be addressed through future advances in image registration and tracking as well as intraoperatively acquired imaging with the ability to yield real-time virtual models.},

  abstract = {Gliomas are a category of infiltrating glial neoplasms that are often located within or near the eloquent areas involved in motor, language, and neurocognitive functions. Surgical resection being the first-line treatment for gliomas, plays a crucial role in patient outcome. The role of the extent of resection (EOR) was evaluated, and we reported significant correlations between a higher EOR and better clinical prognosis of gliomas. However, recurrence is inevitable, even after aggressive tumor removal. Thus, efforts have been made to achieve extended tumor resection beyond contrast-enhanced mass lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined areas, a process known as supratotal resection. Since it has been reported that tumor cells invade beyond regions visible as abnormal areas on MRI, imaging underestimates the true spatial extent of tumors. Furthermore, tumor cells have the potential to spread 10–20 mm away from the MRI-verified tumor boundary. The primary goal of supratotal resection is to maximize EOR and prolong the progression-free and overall survival of patients with gliomas. The available data, as well as our own work, clearly show that supratotal resection of gliomas is a feasible technique that has improved with the aid of awake functional mapping using intraoperative direct electrical stimulation. Awake brain mapping has enabled neurosurgeons achieve supratotal resection with favorable motor, language, and neurocognitive outcomes, ensuring a better quality of life in patients with gliomas.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, the intraoperative visualization of functional data provided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) leading to functional neuronavigation is demonstrated in surgery around the motor strip. METHODS: In seven patients with lesions adjacent to the central region, fMRI was performed with a 1.5- Tesla magnetic resonance system, using axial echo-planar imaging with a motor and a sensory task. Somatosensory and motor evoked fields were recorded with a biomagnetometer. fMRI and MEG were matched to an anatomic three-dimensional magnetic resonance image set by a contour fit. Then this three-dimensional image data set was transferred to the navigation microscope and displayed in the eyepieces of the microscope during surgery. Additionally, intraoperative recording of somatosensory evoked potentials was performed for verification of the central sulcus. RESULTS: In all cases, the projection of fMRI and MEG data into the operating viewing field allowed easy identification of the central region, which was confirmed by phase reversal of somatosensory evoked potentials in each case. fMRI and MEG measurements yielded corresponding results in each patient. CONCLUSION: Functional neuronavigation with integration of fMRI and MEG allows the fast identification of eloquent brain areas. The widespread availability of fMRI will result in a broad availability of functional neuronavigation, which will, in turn, contribute to the successful surgery of lesions in eloquent brain areas with lower morbidity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Modern neuronavigation systems lack spatial accuracy during ongoing surgical procedures because of increasing brain deformation, known as brain shift. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used for quantitative analysis and visualization of this phenomenon. METHODS: For a total of 64 patients, we used a 0.2-T, open-configuration, magnetic resonance imaging scanner, located in an operating theater, for pre- and intraoperative imaging. The three-dimensional imaging data were aligned using rigid registration methods. The maximal displacements of the brain surface, deep tumor margin, and midline structures were measured. Brain shift was observed in two-dimensional image planes using split-screen or overlay techniques, and three-dimensional, color-coded, deformable surface-based data were computed. In selected cases, intraoperative images were transferred to the neuronavigation system to compensate for the effects of brain shift. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that there was great variability in brain shift, ranging up to 24 mm for cortical displacement and exceeding 3 mm for the deep tumor margin in 66\% of all cases. Brain shift was influenced by tissue characteristics, intraoperative patient positioning, opening of the ventricular system, craniotomy size, and resected volume. Intraoperative neuronavigation updating (n = 14) compensated for brain shift, resulting in reliable navigation with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: Without brain shift compensation, neuronavigation systems cannot be trusted at critical steps of the surgical procedure, e.g., identification of the deep tumor margin. Intraoperative imaging allows not only evaluation of and compensation for brain shift but also assessment of the quality of mathematical models that attempt to describe and compensate for brain shift.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the initial clinical experience with intraoperative high-field-strength magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of brain lesions in 200 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients (mean age, 46.1 years; range, 7-84 years), most of whom had glioma or pituitary adenoma, were examined with a 1.5-T MR imager equipped with a rotating operating table and located in a radiofrequency-shielded operating theater. A navigation microscope placed inside the 0.5-mT zone and used in combination with a ceiling-mounted navigation system enabled integrated microscope-based neuronavigation. The extent of resection depicted at intraoperative imaging, the surgical consequences of intraoperative imaging, and the clinical practicability of the operating room setup were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-seven resections with a transsphenoidal approach, 100 craniotomies, and 23 burr-hole procedures were performed. In 55 (27.5\%) of 200 patients, intraoperative MR imaging had immediate surgical consequences (eg, extension of resection in 39\% of patients with pituitary adenoma or glioma). In 108 patients the navigation system was used, and for 37 of those patients, functional imaging data were integrated into the navigation system. There was nearly no difference in quality between pre- and intraoperative images. Intraoperative workflow with intraoperative patient transport for imaging was straightforward, and imaging in most cases began less than 2 minutes after sterile covering of the surgical site. No complications resulted from high-field-strength MR imaging. CONCLUSION: The high-field-strength MR imager was successfully adapted for intraoperative use with the integrated neuronavigation system. Intraoperative MR imaging provided valuable information that allowed intraoperative modification of the surgical strategy. Copyright RSNA, 2004},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intraoperative displacement of major white matter tracts during glioma resection by comparing preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking. METHODS: In 37 patients undergoing glioma surgery, preoperative and intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions. For three-dimensional tractography, we implemented a knowledge-based multiple-region-of-interest approach applying user-defined seed regions in the color-coded maps of fractional anisotropy. Tracking was initiated in both the retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the principal eigenvector in each voxel of the region of interest. The tractography results were also assigned color, applying the convention used in color-coded fractional anisotropy maps. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking was technically feasible in all patients. Fiber tract visualization gave a quick and intuitive overview of the displaced course of white matter tracts in three-dimensional space. Comparison of preoperative and intraoperative tractography depicted a marked shifting of major white matter tracts during glioma removal. Maximum white matter tract shifting ranged from -8 to +15 mm (+2.7 +/- 6.0 mm; mean +/- standard deviation); in 29.7\%, an inward and in 62.2\%, an outward shifting was detected. CONCLUSION: Comparing preoperative and intraoperative fiber tracking visualizes a marked shifting and deformation of major white matter tracts because of tumor removal. This shifting emphasizes the need for an intraoperative update of navigation systems during resection of deep-seated tumor portions near eloquent brain areas. Fiber tracking is a method not only for preoperative neurosurgical visualization but also for further intraoperative planning.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the location of white matter tracts with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) during neurosurgical procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical committee approval and signed informed consent were obtained. A 1.5-T magnetic resonance imager with an adapted rotating surgical table that is placed in a radiofrequency-shielded operating theater was used for pre- and intraoperative imaging. DTI was performed by applying an echo-planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions in 38 patients (20 female patients, 18 male patients; age range, 7-77 years; mean age, 45.6 years) who were undergoing surgery (35 craniotomy and three burr hole procedures). Color-encoded maps of fractional anisotropy were generated by depicting white matter tracts. A rigid registration algorithm was used to compare pre- and intraoperative images. RESULTS: Intraoperative DTI was technically feasible in all patients, and no major image distortions occurred in the areas of interest. Pre- and intraoperative color-encoded maps of fractional anisotropy could be registered; these maps depicted marked and highly variable shifting of white matter tracts during neurosurgical procedures. In the 27 patients who underwent brain tumor resection, white matter tract shifting ranged from an inward shift of 8 mm to an outward shift of 15 mm (mean shift ± standard deviation, outward shift of 2.5 mm ± 5.8). In 16 (59\%) of 27 patients, outward shifting was detected; in eight (30\%), inward shifting was detected. In eight patients who underwent temporal lobe resections for drug-resistant epilepsy, shifting was only inward and ranged from 2 to 14 mm (9 mm ± 3.3). In two of the three patients who underwent burr hole procedures, outward shifting occurred. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative DTI can depict shifting of major white matter tracts that is caused by surgical intervention. © RSNA, 2004.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To implement fiber tracking in a common neuronavigation environment for routine clinical use to visualize major white matter tracts intraoperatively. METHODS: A single-shot, spin-echo diffusion weighted echo planar imaging sequence with six diffusion directions on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance scanner was used for diffusion tensor imaging. For three-dimensional (3-D) tractography, we applied a knowledge-based multiple volume of interest approach. Tracking was initiated in each voxel of the initial seed volume in retrograde and orthograde directions according to the direction of the major eigenvector by applying a tensor deflection algorithm. Tractography results were displayed as streamlines assigned direction encoding color. After selecting the fiber tract bundle of interest by defining inclusion and exclusion volumes, a 3-D object was generated automatically by wrapping the whole fiber tract bundle. This 3-D object was displayed along with other contours representing tumor outline and further functional data with the microscope heads-up display. RESULTS: In 16 patients (three cavernomas, 13 gliomas), major white matter tracts (pyramidal tract, n = 14; optic radiation, n = 2) were visualized intraoperatively with a standard navigation system. Three patients developed a postoperative paresis, which resolved in two in the postoperative course. Additional planning time for tractography amounted to up to 10 minutes. Comparing the tractography results with a fiber bundle generated on a different platform by applying a distortion-free sequence revealed a good congruency of the defined 3-D outlines in the area of interest. CONCLUSION: Fiber tract data can be reliably integrated into a standard neuronavigation system, allowing for intraoperative visualization and localization of major white matter tracts such as the pyramidal tract or optic radiation.},

Major white matter tracts, such as the pyramidal tract, can be delineated by diffusion-tensor-imaging based fiber tracking. These tractography data were integrated into 3-D datasets applied for neuronavigation by rigid registration of the diffusion images with standard anatomical image data so that their course could be superimposed onto the surgical field during resection of gliomas. Intraoperative high-field magnetic resonance imaging was used to compensate for the effects of brain shift, which amounted up to 8 mm. Despite image distortion of echo planar images, which was identified by non-linear registration techniques, navigation was reliable. In none of the 19 patients new postoperative neurological deficits were encountered. Intraoperative visualization of major white matter tracts allows save resection of gliomas near eloquent brain areas.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Awake craniotomy (AC) for removal of intra-axial brain tumors is a well-established procedure. However, the occurrence and consequences of intraoperative seizures during AC have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE:: To analyze the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of seizures during AC. METHODS:: The database of AC at Tel Aviv Medical Center between 2003 to 2011 was reviewed. Occurrences of intraoperative seizures were analyzed with respect to medical history, medications, tumor characteristics, and postoperative outcome. RESULTS:: Of the 549 ACs performed during the index period, 477 with complete records were identified. Sixty patients (12.6\%) experienced intraoperative seizures. The AC procedure failed in 11 patients (2.3\%) due to seizures. Patients with intraoperative seizures were significantly younger than nonseizing patients (45 ± 14 years vs 52 ± 16 years, P = .003), had a higher incidence of frontal lobe involvement (86\% vs \% 57\%, P {$<$} .0001), and had higher prevalence of a history of seizures (P = .008). Short-term motor deterioration developed postoperatively in a higher percentage of patients with intraoperative seizures (20\% vs 10.1\%, P = .02) with a longer hospitalization period (4.0 ± 3.0 days vs 3.0 ± 3.0 days, P = .045). CONCLUSION:: Although in most cases intraoperative seizures will not result in AC failure, the surgical team should be prepared to treat them promptly to avoid intractable seizures. Intraoperative seizures are more common in younger patients with a tumor in the frontal lobe and those with a history of seizures. Moreover, they are associated with a higher incidence of transient postoperative motor deterioration and protracted length of hospital stay. © 2013 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary brain tumors in motor eloquent areas are associated with high-risk surgical procedures because of potentially permanent and often disabling motor deficits. Intraoperative primary motor cortex mapping and corticospinal tract (CST) monitoring are well-developed and reliable techniques. Imaging of the CST by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) is also feasible. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practical value of 3.0T intraoperative MRI (iMRI) with intraoperative DTT (iDTT) in surgery close to the CST, and to compare high-field iDTT with intraoperative neurophysiological CST mapping during glioma and metastasis resection in a routine setting. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (13 males, 12 females, median 47 years) were enrolled prospectively from June 2010 to June 2012. Patients were included if they had a solitary supratentorial intracerebral lesion compressing or infiltrating the CST according to preoperative MRI. Subcortical CST mapping was performed by monopolar (cathodal) stimulation (500 Hz, 400 μs, 5 pulses). CST DTT was made both at preoperative and intraoperative 3.0T MRI. Subcortical motor-evoked potential threshold current and probe-CST distance were recorded at 155 points before and at 103 points after iMRI. Current-distance correlations were performed both for pre-iMRI and for post-iMRI data. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient pre-iMRI was R = 0.470 (P {$<$} .001); post-iMRI, the correlation coefficient was R = 0.338 (P {$<$} .001). MRI radical resection was achieved in 17 patients (68\%), subtotal in 5 (24\%), and partial in 3 (12\%). Postoperative paresis developed in 8 patients (32\%); the paresis was permanent in 1 case (4\%). CONCLUSION: The linear current-distance correlation was found both in pre-iMRI and in post-iMRI data. Intraoperative image distortion appeared in 36\%. Neurophysiological subcortical mapping remains superior to DTT. Combining these 2 methods in selected cases can help increase the safety of tumor resection close to the CST.},

Proximity to eloquent cortical regions often limits resectability and elevates the risk of surgery-related deficits. Therefore, functional localization of eloquent cortex or subcortical fiber tracts can enhance the EOR and functional outcome. Imaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking, and neurophysiological methods like navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetoencephalography, make it possible to identify eloquent areas prior to resective surgery and to tailor indication and surgical approach but also to assess the surgical risk. Intraoperative monitoring with direct cortical stimulation and subcortical stimulation enables surgeons to preserve essential functional tissue during surgery. Through tailored pre- and intraoperative mapping and monitoring the EOR can be maximized, with reduced rates of surgery-related deficits.},

  abstract = {Awake craniotomies (ACs) have become more widely used for glioma patients. In this chapter we will discuss the most recent available data for ACs performed with local anesthesia in comparison with craniotomies under general anesthesia (GA). Originally, ACs were used for epilepsy surgery, but it is now being used in the neuro-oncology field for glioma resection. As with every surgical technique, advantages and disadvantages coexist. Therefore it is imperative to select the most beneficial technique for each patient. Recent evidence suggests that glioma patients tend to benefit from awake procedures. This is due to the surgeon’s ability to perform more accurate cortical and subcortical stimulation, obtain a higher extent of resection, achieve better overall postoperative outcomes, achieve lower rates of postoperative complications which directly impact the patient’s quality of life (QoL), provide a shorter hospital stay, and lower overall health-care costs. However, during awake procedures, breathing rate cannot be controlled, making it difficult to have a controlled CO2 to reduce brain swelling. Awake procedures may also have a big impact on the psyche of the patient, and some of them are not able to tolerate the procedure. In these cases, GA is advantageous, and this technique is still widely used around the globe. Deep sedation is a good alternative for failed procedures, as well as for interventions in which patient positioning does not allow for an awake procedure. Even though GA has its benefits, in the right patient, craniotomies with local anesthesia tend to be more advantageous and provide a better postoperative outcome with a better QoL for the patient.},

  abstract = {Displaying anatomical and physiological information derived from preoperative medical images in the operating room is critical in image-guided neurosurgery. This paper presents a new approach referred to as augmented virtuality (AV) for displaying intraoperative views of the operative field over three-dimensional (3-D) multimodal preoperative images onto an external screen during surgery. A calibrated stereovision system was set up between the surgical microscope and the binocular tubes. Three-dimensional surface meshes of the operative field were then generated using stereopsis. These reconstructed 3-D surface meshes were directly displayed without any additional geometrical transform over preoperative images of the patient in the physical space. Performance evaluation was achieved using a physical skull phantom. Accuracy of the reconstruction method itself was shown to be within 1 mm (median: 0.76 mm ± 0.27), whereas accuracy of the overall approach was shown to be within 3 mm (median: 2.29 mm ± 0.59), including the image-to-physical space registration error. We report the results of six surgical cases where AV was used in conjunction with augmented reality. AV not only enabled vision beyond the cortical surface but also gave an overview of the surgical area. This approach facilitated understanding of the spatial relationship between the operative field and the preoperative multimodal 3-D images of the patient. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Accurately identifying white matter tracts in medical images is essential for various applications, including surgery planning and tractspecific analysis. Supervised machine learning models have reached stateof-the-art solving this task automatically. However, these models are primarily trained on healthy subjects and struggle with strong anatomical aberrations, e.g. caused by brain tumors. This limitation makes them unsuitable for tasks such as preoperative planning, wherefore timeconsuming and challenging manual delineation of the target tract is typically employed. We propose semi-automatic entropy-based active learning for quick and intuitive segmentation of white matter tracts from whole-brain tractography consisting of millions of streamlines. The method is evaluated on 21 openly available healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project and an internal dataset of ten neurosurgical cases. With only a few annotations, the proposed approach enables segmenting tracts on tumor cases comparable to healthy subjects (dice = 0.71), while the performance of automatic methods, like TractSeg dropped substantially (dice = 0.34) in comparison to healthy subjects. The method is implemented as a prototype named atTRACTive in the freely available software MITK Diffusion. Manual experiments on tumor data showed higher efficiency due to lower segmentation times compared to traditional ROI-based segmentation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and tractography allows noninvasive mapping of the structural connections of the brain, and may provide important information for neurosurgical planning. The hyperdirect pathway, connecting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the motor cortex, is assumed to play a key role in mediating the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is an effective but poorly understood treatment for Parkinson disease. This study aimed to apply recent methodological advances in DWI acquisition and analysis to the delineation of the hyperdirect pathway in patients with Parkinson disease selected for surgery. METHODS High spatial and angular resolution DWI data were acquired preoperatively from 5 patients with Parkinson disease undergoing DBS. The authors compared the delineated hyperdirect pathways and associated STN target maps generated by 2 different tractography methods: a tensor-based deterministic method, typically available in clinical settings, and an advanced probabilistic method based on constrained spherical deconvolution. In addition, 10 high-resolution data sets with the same scanning parameters were acquired from a healthy control participant to assess the robustness of the tractography results. RESULTS Both tractography approaches identified connections between the ipsilateral motor cortex and the STN. However, the 2 methods provided substantially different target regions in the STN, with the target center of gravity differing by {$>$} 1.4 mm on average. The probabilistic method (based on constrained spherical deconvolution) plausibly reconstructed a continuous set of connections from the motor cortex, terminating in the dorsolateral region of the STN. In contrast, the tensor-based method reconstructed a comparatively sparser and more variable subset of connections. Furthermore, across the control scans, the probabilistic method identified considerably more consistent targeting regions within the STN compared with the deterministic tensor-based method, which demonstrated a 1.9–2.4 times higher variation. CONCLUSIONS These data provide a strong impetus for the use of a robust probabilistic tractography framework based on constrained spherical deconvolution, or similar advanced DWI models, in clinical settings. The inherent limitations and demonstrated inaccuracy of the tensor-based method leave it questionable for use in high-precision stereotactic DBS surgery. The authors have also described a straightforward method for importing tractography-derived information into any clinical neuronavigation system, based on the generation of track-density images.},

  abstract = {Low-grade gliomas constitute the largest group of cerebral hemispheric tumors in the pediatric population. Although complete tumor resection is generally the goal in the management of these lesions, this can prove difficult to achieve because tumor margins may blend into the surrounding brain. This raises several important questions on the long-term behavior of the residual tumor and the role of adjuvant therapy in the management of these lesions. To examine these issues, the authors reviewed their experience in 71 children with low-grade cerebral hemispheric gliomas who were treated at their institution between 1956 and 1991 and assessed the relationship between clinical, radiographic, pathological, and treatment-related factors and outcome. Only seven patients in the series died, one from perioperative complications, five from progressive disease, and one (a child with neurofibromatosis) from a second neoplasm. For the 70 patients who survived the perioperative period, overall actuarial survivals at 5, 10, and 20 years were 95\%, 93\%, and 85\%, respectively; progression-free status was maintained in 88\%, 79\%, and 76\%, respectively. On univariate analysis, the factor that was most strongly associated with both overall and progression-free survival was the extent of tumor resection (p = 0.013 and p = 0.015, respectively). A relationship between extent of resection and progression-free survival was present both in patients with pilocytic astrocytomas (p = 0.041) and those with nonpilocytic tumors (p = 0.037). Histopathological diagnosis was also associated with overall survival on univariate analysis; poorer results were seen in the patients with nonpilocytic astrocytoma compared to those with other low-grade gliomas, such as pilocytic astrocytoma, mixed glioma, and oligodendroglioma (p = 0.021). The use of radiotherapy was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (p = 0.6). All three patients who ultimately developed histologically confirmed anaplastic changes in the vicinity of the original tumor had received prior radiotherapy, 20, 46, and 137 months, respectively, before the detection of malignant progression. In addition, children who received radiotherapy had a significantly higher incidence of late cognitive and endocrine dysfunction than the nonirradiated patients (p {$<$} 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The authors conclude that children with low-grade gliomas of the cerebral hemispheres have an excellent overall prognosis. Complete tumor resection provides the best opportunity for long-term progression-free survival. However, even with incomplete tumor excision, long-term progression-free survival is common. The findings in this study do not support the routine use of postoperative radiotherapy after an initial incomplete tumor resection: although irradiation appears to increase the likelihood of long-term progression-free survival, overall survival is not improved significantly, and long-term morbidity may be increased.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for movement disorders, including Holmes tremor (HT). HT is a rest and action tremor that occurs as a late symptom of brainstem lesions such as stroke. Unfortunately, it is frequently refractory to medical treatment, hence DBS surgery may be a good option. Due to variable results, the ideal target for DBS in HT still remains to be established, ranging from the thalamus to the globus pallidus internus, to the subthalamic nucleus. Pre-operative imaging also is very challenging, as the complexity of brain fiber architecture may prevent the correct positioning of the directional lead. Herein, we describe the case of a patient affected by a rubral tremor secondary to a brain hemorrhage, who had advanced pre-operative neuroimaging with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)–based tractography obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to identify the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract, involved in the pathophysiology of HT. The patient was then addressed to an awake DBS surgery, and with the help of intraoperative microelectrode recordings, a tailored DRTT-targeted procedure was performed. The stimulation determined an almost complete tremor suppression, with no significant side effects at a follow-up of 6~months, paving the way towards new effective techniques for the planning, i.e., CSD-based tractography and the treatment of refractory tremors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric gliomas are rare and heterogeneous tumors. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database allows a large-scale analysis of the clinical characteristics and prognostic features of these tumors. METHODS: The authors analyzed available SEER data on 6212 patients younger than 20 years at diagnosis of glioma (1973-2005), according to 4 age categories: {$<$}1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years, and 5-20 years. RESULTS: The overall 5- and 10-year survival estimates were 71\%±0.62\% (standard error) and 68\%±0.67\%, respectively. Forty-one percent of gliomas were cerebral; the frequency of cerebellar tumors (22\%-32\% of gliomas) increased sharply after the first year of life. Of the tumors for which grade was available, 77\% were low grade (grade I or II). Tumor grade emerged as the most significant independent prognostic factor in all age groups except the youngest age group, in which extent of resection was most significant. Surgery other than gross total resection was an adverse prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95\% confidence interval, 1.78-2.67). Age {$<$}3 years predicted a greater likelihood of survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and brainstem tumors. Conversely, age {$<$}3 years predicted a lower likelihood of survival in patients with low-grade gliomas. Children aged {$<$}1 year received less radiotherapy than older patients (P {$<$} .0001) and were less likely to undergo gross total resection (P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The survival of children with gliomas is influenced by histologic subtype, age, and extent of resection. Despite its limitations, the SEER database provides a useful tool for studies of rare tumors such as pediatric gliomas. © 2009 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Glioma surgery aims to maximize tumor resection while minimizing the risk of functional decline. The natural history of gliomas is progressive growth with malignant transformation and recurrence; therefore, the role of surgical resection in the natural history of gliomas has been extensively studied in the last three decades although there is still a need for randomized and prospective trials. In this chapter, we present the available data for extent of resection (EOR) for both high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG). The current mainstay for treatment of HGGs is maximal resection followed by radiation therapy with concurrent or adjuvant chemotherapy. There is clear evidence that maximal EOR helps improve both survival rates and clinical factors such as seizure control, steroid burden, and quality of life, although careful balance between EOR and new postoperative deficits is essential. EOR in LGGs is still a very controversial topic since LGGs have been traditionally considered indolent and slow growing tumors. However, the analyses of molecular markers and the malignant transformation of LGGs are gaining importance. Some studies confirm that those LGGs managed with biopsy or subtotal resection and conservative management have a higher risk of malignant transformation compared with those treated with more extensive tumor removal. As we collect long-term survival data and analyze the impact of resection over decades, the evidence points toward an important benefit in maximal resection for LGGs. Finally, studies on EOR are biased by the patient selection criteria, the quantitative methods used to calculate the amount of resection, and the lack of a truly homogeneous patient treatment. Fortunately, technology and clinical knowledge are constantly evolving to improve both the safety of increased EOR and the opportunities to obtain higher quality data available to our patients and the neurosurgical community.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A quantitative analysis of intraoperative cortical shift and deformation was performed to gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of this problem and the resultant loss of spatial accuracy in surgical procedures coregistered to preoperative imaging studies. METHODS: Three- dimensional feature tracking and two-dimensional image analysis of the cortical surface were used to quantify the observed motion. Data acquisition was facilitated by a ceiling-mounted robotic platform, which provided a number of precision tracking capabilities. The patient's head position and the size and orientation of the craniotomy were recorded at the start of surgery. Error analysis demonstrated that the surface displacement measuring methodology was accurate to 1 to 2 mm. Statistical tests were performed to examine correlations between the amount of displacement and the type of surgery, the nature of the cranial opening, the region of the brain involved, the duration of surgery, and the degree of invasiveness. RESULTS: The results showed that a displacement of an average of 1 cm occurred, with the dominant directional component being associated with gravity. The mean displacement was determined to be independent of the size and orientation of the cranial opening. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that loss of spatial registration with preoperative images is gravity-dominated and of sufficient extent that attention to errors resulting from misregistration during the course of surgery is warranted.},

  abstract = {Objective: The optimal therapeutic approach to craniopharyngioma has not been established conclusively. The surgical outcome following radical excision and conservative resection with adjuvant radiotherapy are comparable or even better with the later in pediatric or mixed populations. This study is aimed at reviewing the role of extent of resection in local tumor control and long-term outcome in adults with craniopharyngioma. Patients and methods: Ninety-five adults operated between 2001 and 2013 were included. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Predictors of various outcome parameters were analyzed. Results: The predominant presenting symptom was visual impairment (78 \%) followed by symptoms of hypothalamic involvement (29 \%). Total and subtotal excisions (TE, STE) were achieved in 63 \%, and 47 \% of patients, respectively. Vision improved in 62 \% of patients in the early postoperative period. Thirteen patients (14 \%) experienced vision deterioration postoperatively. On multivariate analysis, tumor {$>$}3 cm and optic atrophy predicted poor visual outcome. Hormonal replacement for hypopituitarism was required in 83 \% during follow-up. Diabetes insipidus was seen in 73 \%. Imaging evidence of 3rd ventricular floor destruction by tumor emerged as an independent predictor of postoperative hypothalamic morbidities. The recurrence rate following TE and STE was 11.6 \% and 72 \%, respectively. Unlike radical excision, PFS following STE was significantly shorter (p- 0.02). TE was not associated with increased visual impairment or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction postoperatively as compared to STE. Most of the patients (85 \%) were independent and able to return to the premorbid occupation. Conclusion: Subtotal resection provides equally good long-term visual, endocrinological, and hypothalamic outcomes as radical surgery. When used with adjuvant radiotherapy, it also gives a better local control of the tumor. Hence, subtotal resection with adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered as an effective alternative strategy to radical excision.},

However, brain shift was realized early on as a limitation which renders frameless stereotaxy less useful toward the later stages of tumor resection. Intraoperative MRI has proven to be useful in updating intraoperative images and thus maintaining the accuracy of navigation. The exploitation of tumor cell biochemistry led to adaptation of tumor fluorescence-guided surgery and has revolutionized high-grade glioma surgery. Furthermore, direct cell visualization techniques in tumor margins, such as with Raman spectroscopy or confocal microscopy, are exciting prospects that have the potential to take navigation-based tumor surgery to the next level. Future advances in intraaxial tumor navigation are likely from integration of multimodal MRI (including functional MRI and tractography) with intraoperative brain shift correction, awake functional mapping, and augmented reality platforms.},

Intraoperative navigation using MRI-based tractography and electrophysiological monitoring of the visual pathways may allow maximal resection while preserving visual function. In this study, the authors evaluated the value of visual pathway mapping in a series of patients undergoing awake craniotomy for tumor resection. METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted in 18 patients who underwent an awake craniotomy for resection of intraaxial tumors involving or adjacent to the OR. Preoperative MRI-based tractography was used for intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative acquisition of 3D ultrasonography images was performed for real-time imaging and correction of brain shift. Goggles with light-emitting diodes were used as a standard visual stimulus. Direct cortical visual evoked potential (VEP) recording, subcortical recordings from the OR, and subcortical stimulation of the OR were used intraoperatively to assess visual function and proximity of the lesion to the OR. VFs were assessed pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS Baseline cortical VEP recordings were available for 14 patients (77.7\%). No association was found between preoperative VF status and baseline presence of cortical VEPs (p = 0.27). Five of the 14 patients (35.7\%) who underwent subcortical stimulation of the OR reported seeing phosphenes in the corresponding contralateral VF. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.899, p = 0.04) between the subcortical threshold stimulation intensity (3-11.5 mA) and the distance from the OR. Subcortical recordings from the OR demonstrated a typical VEP waveform in 10 of the 13 evaluated patients (76.9\%). These waveforms were present only when recordings were obtained within 10 mm of the OR (p = 0.04). Seven patients (38.9\%) had postoperative VF deterioration, and it was associated with a length of {$<$} 8 mm between the tumor and the OR (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring of the visual pathways is feasible but may be of limited value in preserving the functional integrity of the posterior visual pathways. Subcortical stimulation of the OR may identify the location of the OR when done in proximity to the pathways, but such proximity may be associated with increased risk of postoperative worsening of the VF deficit.},

  abstract = {Surgical navigation systems provide the surgeon with a display of preoperative and intraoperative data in the same coordinate system. However, the systems currently in use in neurosurgery are subject to inaccuracy caused by intraoperative brain deformation (brain shift), since they typically assume that the intracranial structures are rigid. Experiments show brain shift of up to 1 cm, making it the dominant error in the system. We propose a biomechanical-model-based approach for rain shift compensation. Two models are presented: a damped spring-mass model and a model based on continuum mechanics. Both models are guided by limited intraoperative (exposed brain) surface data, with the aim to recover the deformation in the full volume. The two models are compared and their advantages and disadvantages discussed. A partial validation using intraoperative MR image sequences indicates that the approach reduces the error caused by brain shift. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, valid data concerning the reliability of tracking with respect to the actual pathoanatomical situation are lacking. We retrospectively correlated fiber tracking based on magnetic resonance (MR) DT imaging with the histopathological data of 25 patients with WHO grade II and III gliomas. Fiber tracking using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) method was performed to investigate the integrity of white matter tracts in the surrounding border zone of the lesions. The tracking procedure was stopped when fractional anisotropy (FA) thresholds = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3, or a tract turning angle {$>$} 60° were encountered. In 9 patients we were able to reconstruct brain fiber tracts at biopsy loci (2-32\% tumor infiltration) using an FA threshold of 0.15 and 0.2, but not for a threshold of 0.25 or 0.3. The neurological outcome demonstrated potential tumor cell infiltration of functionally intact brain fiber tracts in the range of 2-8\%.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now available with the General Electric MRI system for dedicated intraoperative use. Alternatively, non-dedicated MRI systems require fewer specific adaptations of instrumentation and surgical techniques. In this report, clinical experiences with such a system are presented. METHODS: All patients were surgically treated in a 'twin operating theater,' consisting of a conventional operating theater with complete neuronavigation equipment (StealthStation and MKM), which allowed surgery with magnetically incompatible instruments, conventional instrumentation and operating microscope, and a radiofrequency-shielded operating room designed for use with an intraoperative MRI scanner (Magnetom Open; Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). The Magnetom Open is a 0.2-T MRI scanner with a resistive magnet and specific adaptations that are necessary to integrate the scanner into the surgical environment. The operating theaters lie close together, and patients can be intraoperatively transported from one room to the other. This retrospective analysis includes 55 patients with cerebral lesions, all of whom were surgically treated between March 1996 and September 1997. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with supratentorial tumors were surgically treated (with navigational guidance) in the conventional operating room, with intraoperative MRI for resection control. For 5 of these 31 patients, intraoperative resection control revealed significant tumor remnants, which led to further tumor resection guided by the information provided by intraoperative MRI. Intraoperative MRI resection control was performed in 18 transsphenoidal operations. In cases with suspected tumor remnants, the surgeon reexplored the sellar region; additional tumor tissue was removed in three of five cases. Follow-up scans were obtained for all patients I week and 2 to 3 months after surgery. For 14 of the 18 patients, the images obtained intraoperatively were comparable to those obtained after 2 to 3 months. Intraoperative MRI was also used for six patients undergoing temporal lobe resections for treatment of pharmacoresistant seizures. For these patients, the extent of neocortical and mesial resection was tailored to fit the preoperative findings of morphological and electrophysiological alterations, as well as intraoperative electrocorticographic findings. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative MRI with the Magnetom Open provides considerable additional information to optimize resection during surgical treatment of supratentorial tumors, pituitary adenomas, and epilepsy. The twin operating theater is a true alternative to a dedicated MRI system. Additional efforts are necessary to improve patient transportation time and instrument guidance within the scanner.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Tractography derived from diffusion MRI can provide important insights into human brain microstructure in vivo. Neurosurgeons were quick to adopt the technique at the turn of the century, but it remains plagued by technical fallibilities. This study aims to describe how tractography is deployed clinically in a modern-day, public healthcare system, serving as a snapshot from the ‘shop floor’ of British neurosurgical practice. Methods: An 11-question survey was circulated to the mailing lists of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and British Neurosurgical Trainees’ Association, including questions on frequency, indication, tracts reconstructed, specific details of techniques used and personnel by whom it was performed, and a free-text section on the limitations of tractography. Results: 58 survey responses were received, covering all 40 neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland. Overall, responses were received from neurosurgeons at 36 units (90.0\%) stating tractography was in use at that unit. 74.1\% of the responses were from Consultants. The most common indication for tractography was in tumour resection. It was most commonly performed by neuroradiologists or imaging scientists. 75.9\% of respondents stated that the model used to process tractography was the diffusion tensor (DTI). Many respondents were unaware of which algorithm (74.1\%) or software tools (65.6\%) were used by the operator to produce tractography visualisations. The corticospinal tract was the most commonly reconstructed tract. The most commonly cited limitations of the technique were perceived inaccuracy and brain shift. Conclusions: In this UK-based survey of practising neurosurgeons, we show that 90\% of neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland use tractography regularly; that predominantly DTI-based reconstructions are used; that tumour resection remains the most frequent use of the technique; and that large tracts such as the corticospinal tract are most frequently identified. Many neurosurgeons remain unfamiliar with the underlying methods used to produce tractography visualisations.},

  abstract = {Microsurgical resection of primary brain tumors located within or near eloquent areas is challenging. Primary aim is to preserve neurological function, while maximizing the extent of resection (EOR), to optimize long-term neurooncological outcomes and quality of life. Here, we review the combined integration of awake craniotomy and intraoperative MRI (IoMRI) for primary brain tumors, due to their multiple challenges. A systematic review of the literature was performed, in accordance with the Prisma guidelines. Were included 13 series and a total number of 527 patients, who underwent 541 surgeries. We paid particular attention to operative time, rate of intraoperative seizures, rate of initial complete resection at the time of first IoMRI, the final complete gross total resection (GTR, complete radiological resection rates), and the immediate and definitive postoperative neurological complications. The mean duration of surgery was 6.3 h (median 7.05, range 3.8–7.9). The intraoperative seizure rate was 3.7\% (range 1.4–6; I\^2 = 0\%, P heterogeneity = 0.569, standard error = 0.012, p = 0.002). The intraoperative complete resection rate at the time of first IoMRI was 35.2\% (range 25.7–44.7; I\^2 = 66.73\%, P heterogeneity = 0.004, standard error = 0.048, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of patients who underwent supplementary resection after one or several IoMRI was 46\% (range 39.8–52.2; I\^2 = 8.49\%, P heterogeneity = 0.364, standard error = 0.032, p {$<$} 0.001). The GTR rate at discharge was 56.3\% (range 47.5–65.1; I\^2 = 60.19\%, P heterogeneity = 0.01, standard error = 0.045, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of immediate postoperative complications was 27.4\% (range 15.2–39.6; I\^2 = 92.62\%, P heterogeneity {$<$} 0.001, standard error = 0.062, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of permanent postoperative complications was 4.1\% (range 1.3–6.9; I\^2 = 38.52\%, P heterogeneity = 0.123, standard error = 0.014, p = 0.004). Combined use of awake craniotomy and IoMRI can help in maximizing brain tumor resection in selected patients. The technical obstacles to doing so are not severe and can be managed by experienced neurosurgery and anesthesiology teams. The benefits of bringing these technologies to bear on patients with brain tumors in or near language areas are obvious. The lack of equipoise on this topic by experienced practitioners will make it difficult to do a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. In the opinion of the authors, such a trial would be unnecessary and would deprive some patients of the benefits of the best available methods for their tumor resections.},

Optimising this balance remains hindered by our still limited understanding of information processing in the human brain. To help understand individual differences in functional outcomes following neuro-oncological treatment, we review mounting evidence demonstrating the fundamental role that white matter connections play in complex human behaviour. We focus on selected fibre tracts whose destruction is recognised to elicit predictable behavioural deficits and consider specific indications for non-invasive diffusion MRI tractography, the only existing method to map these fibre tracts in vivo, in the selection and planning of neuro-oncological treatments. Despite remaining challenges, longitudinal tract imaging, in combination with intraoperative testing and neuropsychological evaluation, offers unique opportunities to refine our understanding of human brain organisation in the quest to predict and ultimately reduce the quality of life burden of both surgical and non-surgical first-line neuro-oncological therapies. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

  abstract = {Intraoperatively acquired diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in cranial tumor surgery are used for early detection of ischemic brain injuries, which could result in impaired neurological outcome and their presence might thus influence the neurosurgeon’s decision on further resection. The phenomenon of false-negative DWI findings in intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) has only been reported in single cases and therefore yet needs to be further analyzed. This retrospective single-center study’s objective was the identification and characterization of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI with new or enlarged ischemic areas on postoperative MRI (poMRI). Out of 225 cranial tumor surgeries with intraoperative DWI sequences, 16 cases with no additional resection after ioMRI and available in-time poMRI ({$<$} 14 days) were identified. Of these, a total of 12 cases showed false-negative DWI in ioMRI (75\%). The most frequent tumor types were oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (4 each). In 5/12 cases (41.7\%), an ischemic area was already present in ioMRI, however, volumetrically increased in poMRI (mean infarct growth + 2.1 cm 3 ; 0.48–3.6), whereas 7 cases (58.3\%) harbored totally new infarcts on poMRI (mean infarct volume 0.77 cm 3 ; 0.05–1.93). With this study we provide the most comprehensive series of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI that were not followed by additional resection. Our study underlines the limitations of intraoperative DWI sequences for the detection and size-estimation of hyperacute infarction. The awareness of this phenomenon is crucial for any neurosurgeon utilizing ioMRI.},

Variable locations, extent of resection, postoperative neurodiagnostic evaluation, and histology have confounded therapy and outcome. ObjectiveS:: To investigate disease control and survival after surgery. Methods: A prospective natural history trial from 1991 to 1996 produced a subset of patients with low-grade gliomas managed by primary surgery and subsequent observation. Patients were evaluable if eligibility, tumor location, and extent of resection were confirmed by pathological diagnosis, preoperative and postoperative imaging, and the surgeon's report. Primary end points were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and postprogression survival. Results: Of 726 patients enrolled, 518 were fully evaluable for analysis. The 5- and 8-year OS rates were 97\% ± 0.8\% and 96\% ± 0.9\%, respectively, and PFS rates were 80\% ± 1.8\% and 78\% ± 2.0\%. In univariate analyses, histological type, extent of residual tumor, and disease site were significantly associated with PFS and OS. In multivariate analysis, gross total resection (GTR) without residual disease was the predominant predictor of PFS. In patients with limited residual disease, 56\% were free of progression at 5 years. Conclusion: GTR should be the goal when it can be achieved with an acceptable functional outcome. The variable rate of progression after incomplete resection highlights the need for new predictors of tumor behavior. Copyright © 2011 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based functional neuronavigation in surgery of cerebral gliomas with pyramidal tract (PT) involvement with respect to both perioperative assessment and follow-up outcome. METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted between 2001 and 2005. A consecutive series of 238 eligible patients with initial imaging diagnosis of cerebral gliomas involving PTs were randomized into study (n = 118) and control (n = 120) groups. The study cases underwent DTI and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The maps of fractional anisotropy were calculated for PT mapping. Both three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data sets and fractional anisotropy maps were integrated by rigid registration, after which the tumor and adjacent PT were segmented and reconstructed for presurgical planning and intraoperative guidance. The control cases were operated on using routine neuronavigation. RESULTS: There was a trend for high-grade gliomas (HGGs) in the study group to be more likely to achieve gross total resection (74.4 versus 33.3\%, P {$<$} 0.001). There was no significant difference of low-grade gliomas resection between the two groups. Postoperative motor deterioration occurred in 32.8\% of control cases, whereas it occurred in only 15.3\% of the study cases (P {$<$} 0.001). The 6-month Karnofsky Performance Scale score of study cases was significantly higher than that of control cases (86 +/- 20 versus 74 +/- 28 overall, P {$<$} 0.001; 93 +/- 10 versus 86 +/- 17 for low-grade gliomas, P = 0.013; and 77 +/- 27 versus 53 +/- 32 for HGGs, P = 0.001). For 81 HGGs, the median survival of study cases was 21.2 months (95\% confidence interval, 14.1-28.3 mo) compared with 14.0 months (95\% confidence interval, 10.2-17.8 mo) of control cases (P = 0.048). The estimated hazard ratio for the effect of DTI-based functional neuronavigation was 0.570, representing a 43.0\% reduction in the risk of death. CONCLUSION: DTI-based functional neuronavigation contributes to maximal safe resection of cerebral gliomas with PT involvement, thereby decreasing postoperative motor deficits for both HGGs and low-grade gliomas while increasing high-quality survival for HGGs.},

  abstract = {A cancer diagnosis is life altering and frequently associated with both acute and long-lasting psychosocial and behavioral distress for patients. The impact of a diffuse glioma diagnosis on mental health is an important aspect of the patient experience with their disease. This needs to be understood by neurosurgeons so these concerns can be appropriately addressed in a timely fashion and integrated into the multidisciplinary care of neuro-oncology patients. The relatively grave prognosis associated with diffuse gliomas, the morbidity associated with treatment, and the constant threat of developing a new neurological deficit all can negatively affect a patient’s mental ability to cope and ultimately manifest in mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. The objective of this systematic review was to describe the variety of behavioral health disorders patients may experience following a glioma diagnosis and discuss possible treatment options. The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched through July 1, 2022, using broad search terms, which resulted in 5028 studies that were uploaded to Covidence systematic review software. Duplicates, non–English-language studies, and studies with irrelevant outcomes or incorrect design were removed (n = 3167). A total of 92 articles reporting behavioral health outcomes in brain tumor patients were categorized and extracted for associations with overall mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, stress, pharmacology, interventions, and mental health in caregivers. The authors identified numerous studies reporting the prevalence of mental health disorders and their negative influence in this population. However, there is a paucity of literature on therapeutic options for patients. Given the strong correlation between patient quality of life and mental well-being, there is a considerable need for early recognition and treatment of these behavioral health disorders to optimize everyday functioning for patients.},

  abstract = {Balancing the benefit of extensive tumor resection with the consequence of potential postoperative language deficits remains a challenge in glioma surgery involving language areas. This study is designed to evaluate the impact of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and functional neuronavigation on surgical outcome in patients with gliomas involving language areas. Two hundred seventeen patients were prospectively enrolled, 124 in the study group underwent iMRI and functional neuronavigation-guided microsurgery and 93 in the control group underwent conventional navigation-guided microsurgery. Extent of tumor volume resection (EoR) and rate of gross total resection (rGTR) were calculated perioperatively. Aphasia quotient (AQ) was assessed to evaluate the change of language function perioperatively and at 6-month follow-up. Survival outcome for glioblastoma, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), were recorded. In 198 glioma patients (112 in the study group and 86 in the control group), EoR (95.50 versus 89.85~\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and rGTR (69.60 versus 47.70~\%, p\,=\,0.002) were significantly higher in the study group, and language functions were also better at 6-month follow-up in the study group (87.47 versus 78.73, p\,=\,0.001). Furthermore, postoperative new aphasia occurred in 34.8~\% of the control group, whereas it occurred only in 2.3~\% of the study group (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). In addition, PFS (12.5 versus 6.6~m, p\,=\,0.003) and OS (19.6 versus 13.0~m, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) for patients with glioblastomas were dramatically prolonged in the study group than in the control group. These results indicated that iMRI and functional neuronavigation may help maximize tumor resection, minimize language deficits in patients with gliomas involving language areas, and improve survival time for patients with glioblastomas.},
