  abstract = {Previous studies to simulate brain tumor progression, often investigate either temporal changes in cancer cell density or the overall tissue-level growth of the tumor mass. Here, we developed a computational model to bridge these two approaches. The model incorporates the tumor biomechanical response at the tissue level and accounts for cellular events by modeling cancer cell proliferation, infiltration to surrounding tissues, and invasion to distant locations. Moreover, acquisition of high resolution human data from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and perfusion imaging was employed within the simulations towards a realistic and patient specific model. The model predicted the intratumoral mechanical stresses to range from 20 to 34 kPa, which caused an up to 4.5 mm displacement to the adjacent healthy tissue. Furthermore, the model predicted plausible cancer cell invasion patterns within the brain along the white matter fiber tracts. Finally, by varying the tumor vascular density and its invasive outer ring thickness, our model showed the potential of these parameters for guiding the timing (83–90 days) of cancer cell distant invasion as well as the number (0–2 sites) and location (temportal and/or parietal lobe) of the invasion sites.},

Extent of resection (EOR) has been shown to be an important prognostic factor for survival in patients undergoing initial resection of glioblastoma (GBM), but the significance of EOR at repeat craniotomy for recurrence remains unclear. In this study the authors investigate the impact of EOR at initial and repeat resection of GBM on overall survival. Methods. Medical records were reviewed for all patients undergoing craniotomy for GBM at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center from January 1, 2005, through August 15, 2009. Patients who had a second craniotomy for pathologically confirmed recurrence following radiation and chemotherapy were evaluated. Volumetric EOR was measured and classified as gross-total resection (GTR, {$>$} 95\% by volume) or subtotal resection (STR, ≤ 95\% by volume) after independent radiological review. Overall survival was compared between groups using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for known prognostic factors, including age, eloquent location, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and adjuvant therapies. Results. Multiple resections were performed in 107 patients. Fifty-two patients had initial GTR, of whom 31 (60\%) had GTR at recurrence, with a median survival of 20.4 months (standard error [SE] 1.0 months), and 21 (40\%) had STR at recurrence, with a median survival of 18.4 months (SE 0.5 months) (difference not statistically significant). Initial STR was performed in 55 patients, of whom 26 (47\%) had GTR at recurrence, with a median survival of 19.0 months (SE 1.2 months), and 29 (53\%) had STR, with a median survival of 15.9 months (SE 1.2 months) (p = 0.004). A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed demonstrating that age (HR 1.03, p = 0.004), KPS score at recurrence (HR 2.4, p = 0.02), and EOR at repeat resection (HR 0.62, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of survival. Extent of initial resection was not a statistically significant factor (p = 0.13) when repeat EOR was included in the model, suggesting that GTR at second craniotomy could overcome the effect of an initial STR. Conclusions. Extent of resection at recurrence is an important predictor of overall survival. If GTR is achieved at recurrence, overall survival is maximized regardless of initial EOR, suggesting that patients with initial STR may benefit from surgery with a GTR at recurrence.},

  abstract = {Object. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) frequently infiltrate highly functional or "eloquent" brain areas. Given the lack of long-term survival data, the prognostic significance of eloquent brain tumor location and the role of functional mapping during resective surgery in presumed eloquent brain regions are unknown. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of 281 cases involving adults who underwent resection of a supratentorial LGG at a brain tumor referral center. Preoperative MR images were evaluated blindly for involvement of eloquent brain areas, including the sensorimotor and language cortices, and specific subcortical structures. For high-risk tumors located in presumed eloquent brain areas, long-term survival estimates were evaluated for patients who underwent intraoperative functional mapping with electrocortical stimulation and for those who did not. Results. One hundred and seventy-four patients (62\%) had high-risk LGGs that were located in presumed eloquent areas. Adjusting for other known prognostic factors, patients with tumors in areas presumed to be eloquent had worse overall and progression-free survival (OS, hazard ratio [HR] 6.1, 95\% CI 2.6-14.1; PFS, HR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.2-2.9; Cox proportional hazards). Confirmation of tumor overlapping functional areas during intraoperative mapping was strongly associated with shorter survival (OS, HR 9.6, 95\% CI 3.6-25.9). In contrast, when mapping revealed that tumor spared true eloquent areas, patients had significantly longer survival, nearly comparable to patients with tumors that clearly involved only noneloquent areas, as demonstrated by preoperative imaging (OS, HR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.0-8.5). Conclusions. Presumed eloquent location of LGGs is an important but modifiable risk factor predicting disease progression and death. Delineation of true functional and nonfunctional areas by intraoperative mapping in high-risk patients to maximize tumor resection can dramatically improve long-term survival.},

  abstract = {Objective. High dose fluorescein sodium has been utilized for fluorescence-guided tumor resection with conflicting reports on the efficacy of this procedure. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the utility and clinical limitations of using fluorescein sodium for the treatment and resection of glioma brain tumors. Methods. Patients diagnosed with glioma were divided into two groups with a total of 22 patients enrolled in the study: 1) the study group (n=10), patients that received intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium and 2) the control group (n=12), patients that did not receive injections during surgical resection. Quality of life was evaluated according to Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score and neurological status. Fluorescein sodium was intravenously injected at a dose of 15-20mg/kg of body weight. Glioma resection was evaluated preopera-tive and postoperatively with enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Results. Significant differences in the gross total resection (GTR) rates were observed be-tween the two patient groups (Fisher's Exact Test p=0.047). Progressive free survival was significantly longer in the study group (Student's T-Test p=0.033) as well as in the GTR group (Student's T-Test p=0.0001) compared to the control and non-GTR groups, respectively. Three patients in the study group and four patients in the control group had transient neu-rological deterioration. One patient in the control group had permanent hemiplegia. Conclusion. The intraoperative utility of using fluorescein sodium can significantly increase the GTR rate without obvious deterioration. In addition, we find that it is better to apply the fluorescein sodium in the cases with BBB (blood-brain barrier) disruption, which had been enhanced in preoperative MRI. © Ivyspring International Publisher.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. No age-adjusted or histologic-adjusted assessments of the association between extent of resection and risk of either recurrence or death exist for neurosurgical patients who undergo resection of low-grade glioma using intraoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) guidance. METHODS. The current data included 156 patients who underwent surgical resection of a unifocal, supratentorial, low-grade glioma in the MRI suite at Brigham and Women's Hospital between January 1, 1997, and January 31, 2003. Estimates of disease-free and overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The association between extent of resection and these probabilities was measured using a Cox proportional hazards model. Observed death rates were compared with the expected death rate using age-specific and histologic-specific survival rates obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry. RESULTS. Patients who underwent subtotal resection were at 1.4 times the risk of disease recurrence (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.7-3.1) and at 4.9 times the risk of death (95\% CI, 0.61-40.0) relative to patients who underwent gross total resection. The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year age-adjusted and histologic-adjusted death rates for patients who underwent surgical resection using intraoperative MRI guidance were 1.9\% (95\% CI, 0.3-4.2\%), 3.6\% (95\% CI, 0.4-6.7\%), and 17.6\% (95\% CI, 5.9-29.3\%), respectively: significantly lower than the rates reported using national data bases. CONCLUSIONS. The data from the current study suggested a possible association between surgical resection and survival for neurosurgical patients who underwent surgery for low-grade glioma under intraoperative MRI guidance. Further study within the context of a large, prospective, population-based project will be needed to confirm these findings. © 2005 American Cancer Society.},

Preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and tractography are capable of providing the data required for safe "surgical planning" at both the cortical and subcortical levels. Methods We report our experience regarding high-grade gliomas affecting the dominant angular gyrus (AG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and their respective subcortical areas using intraoperative MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Retrospectively, we reviewed a consecutive series of 27 patients operated in a BrainSuite for high-grade intraparenchymal tumors of the left posterior temporoparietal junction. We included tumors involving the dominant AG, SMG, and/or IPS and the subcortical course of arcuate fasciculus (AF) and all the patients who underwent preoperative fMRI and DTI to localize the AF and the eloquent cortical areas. Just after craniotomy, new volumetric MRI and DTI verified and corrected possible brain shift. After the gross total resection was carried out, and before approaching the residual mass close to the white matter tract, an intraoperative MRI was again performed. Results We operated on 27 patients, 15 males and 12 females, whose diagnosis was always high-grade glioma. During the preoperative neurologic examination, 6 patients were asymptomatic; 3 presented a Gerstmann syndrome; 16 showed dysphasic disturbances, 6 of which were associated with visual field deficits; and 2 showed weakness of the right limb. Conclusions Our results suggest that this approach is completely safe and effective as an alternative to awake surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. The objectives of this study were to register the brain locations in a consecutive series of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and compare these localizations with the locations of de novo glioblastomas (GBMs) that were collected during the same period in an effort to analyze whether LGGs are situated in preferential areas and to review the pathophysiologic hypothesis of such a phenomenon. METHODS. One hundred thirty-two patients with LGG and 102 patients with GBM who were followed consecutively between 1996 and 2003 by the authors were reviewed, whatever their treatment. Using anatomic, three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, the location of each tumor was analyzed accurately according to a classification system based on the proximity of eloquent areas previously reported by the authors. RESULTS. One hundred nine LGGs (82.6\%), compared with 55 GBMs (53.9\%), were situated within functional regions (P {$<$} 0.001). More specifically, 36 LGGs (27.3\%), compared with 11 GBMs (10.8\%), were localized in the region of the supplementary motor area (SMA) (P {$<$} 0.001); and 33 LGGs (25\%), compared with 11 GBMs (10.8\%), were located within the insula (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The current findings suggest that LGGs are located preferentially in "secondary" functional areas (immediately near the so-called primary eloquent regions), especially within the SMA and the insular lobe. This preferential localization may be explained by developmental, cytomyeloarchitectonic, neurochemical, metabolic, and functional reasons. A better knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying preferential LGGs locations may improve understanding of the genesis and natural history of these tumors and, subsequently, their management. © 2004 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravoxel incoherent motion MRI has been proposed as an alternative method to measure brain perfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters (the perfusion fraction, the pseudodiffusion coefficient, and the flow-related parameter) to differentiate high- and low-grade brain gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were assessed in 21 brain gliomas (16 high-grade, 5 low-grade). Images were acquired by using a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion pulse sequence, with 16 values of b (0-900 s/mm 2) in 3 orthogonal directions on 3T systems equipped with 32 multichannel receiver head coils. The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were derived by fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion biexponential model. Regions of interest were drawn in regions of maximum intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and contralateral control regions. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student t test. In addition, regions of interest were drawn around all whole tumors and were evaluated with the help of histograms. RESULTS: In the regions of maximum perfusion fraction, perfusion fraction was significantly higher in the high-grade group (0.127±0.031) than in the low-grade group (0.084 ± 0.016, P {$<$} .001) and in the contralateral control region (0.061 ± 0.011, P {$<$} .001). No statistically significant difference was observed for the pseudodiffusion coefficient. The perfusion fraction correlated moderately with dynamic susceptibility contrast relative CBV (r=0.59). The histograms of the perfusion fraction showed a "heavy-tailed" distribution for high-grade but not low-grade gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction is helpful for differentiating high- from low-grade brain gliomas.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Neuronavigation based on preoperative imaging data is a ubiquitous tool for image guidance in neurosurgery. However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration. Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift. METHODS: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring due to physical, surgical or biological factors. RESULTS: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention. The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful. CONCLUSION: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.

  abstract = {Objective: Posterior fossa tumours in children predispose to hydrocephalus, although the natural history is unclear and the need for drainage of the ventricles is controversial. We report on the natural history of ventriculomegaly and tonsillar herniation, as seen on serial MRI scans in children with posterior fossa tumours. Results: Eighty-nine children with posterior fossa tumours were reviewed retrospectively. Overall, 18 (20\%) patients required permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage in the form of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (n = 15) or third ventriculostomy (n = 3). On pre-operative MRI scan, the ventricular size was assessed by measurement of the ventricular index (VI) and 59 patients (66\%) had a VI greater than 0.4. There was a progressive decrease in the mean VI from pre-operative to post-operative MRI scans and beyond 3-9 months after surgery, the mean VI was less than 0.4 (p = 0.0001). Patients requiring permanent CSF drainage had a greater VI pre-operatively and at 3-9 months post-operatively (p {$<$} 0.05). On pre-operative MRI scan, 75 patients (84\%) had greater than 5 mm herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum. There was a progressive decrease in the mean tonsillar herniation from pre-operative to post-operative MRI scans, with time (p = 0.0001), although this did not relate to the need for CSF drainage. On multivariate analysis, the need for permanent CSF drainage was associated with pre- and intra-operative CSF drainage (odds ratio = 23.3; p = 0.0001) and incomplete surgical excision of tumour (odds ratio = 7.7; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Hydrocephalus and tonsillar herniation are common in children with posterior fossa tumours, although post-operatively there is a natural tendency for it to resolve and only a fifth of the patients needed permanent CSF drainage. We recommend selective drainage of CSF in children with posterior fossa tumours. Patients at risk are those with severe symptoms at presentation, needing perioperative CSF drainage and those with subtotal resection of tumour. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Estimation of brain deformation is crucial during neurosurgery. Whilst mechanical characterisation captures stress–strain relationships of tissue, biomechanical models are limited by experimental conditions. This results in variability reported in the literature. The aim of this work was to demonstrate a generative model of strain energy density functions can estimate the elastic properties of tissue using observed brain deformation. Methods: For the generative model a Gaussian Process regression learns elastic potentials from 73 manuscripts. We evaluate the use of neo-Hookean, Mooney–Rivlin and 1-term Ogden meta-models to guarantee stability. Single and multiple tissue experiments validate the ability of our generative model to estimate tissue properties on a synthetic brain model and in eight temporal lobe resection cases where deformation is observed between pre- and post-operative images. Results: Estimated parameters on a synthetic model are close to the known reference with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm between surface nodes for single and multiple tissue experiments. In clinical cases, we were able to recover brain deformation from pre- to post-operative images reducing RMSE of differences from 1.37 to 1.08 mm on the ventricle surface and from 5.89 to 4.84 mm on the resection cavity surface. Conclusion: Our generative model can capture uncertainties related to mechanical characterisation of tissue. When fitting samples from elastography and linear studies, all meta-models performed similarly. The Ogden meta-model performed the best on hyperelastic studies. We were able to predict elastic parameters in a reference model on a synthetic phantom. However, deformation observed in clinical cases is only partly explained using our generative model.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Preservation of the visual field in glioma surgery, especially avoidance of hemianopia, is crucial for patients' quality of life, particularly for driving. Recent studies used tractography or cortical occipital stimulation to try to avoid visual deficit. However, optic radiations have not been directly mapped intraoperatively. The authors present, for the first time to their knowledge, a consecutive series of awake surgeries for cerebral glioma with intrasurgical identification and preservation of visual pathways using subcortical electrical mapping. METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent awake resection of a glioma (1 WHO Grade I, 11 WHO Grade II, 2 WHO Grade III) involving the optic radiations. The patients had no presurgical visual field deficit. Intraoperatively, a picture-naming task was used, with presentation of 2 objects situated diagonally on a screen divided into 4 quadrants. An image was presented in the quadrant to be saved and another image was presented in the opposite quadrant. Direct subcortical electrostimulation was repeatedly performed without the patient's knowledge, until optic radiations were identified (transient visual disturbances). All patients underwent an objective visual field assessment 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: All patients experienced visual symptoms during stimulation. These disturbances led the authors to stop the tumor resection at that level. Postoperatively, only 1 patient had a permanent hemianopia, despite an expected quadrantanopia in 12 cases. The mean extent of resection was 93.6\% (range 85\%-100\%). CONCLUSIONS: Online identification of optic radiations by direct subcortical electrostimulation is a reliable and effective method to avoid permanent hemianopia in surgery for gliomas involving visual pathways.},

  abstract = {DTI is a technique that identifies white matter tracts (WMT) non-invasively in healthy and non-healthy patients using diffusion measurements. Similar to visual pathways (VP), WMT are not visible with classical MRI or intra-operatively with microscope. DIT will help neurosurgeons to prevent destruction of the VP while removing lesions adjacent to this WMT. We have performed DTI on fifty patients before and after surgery between March 2012 to January 2014. To navigate we used a 3DT1-weighted sequence. Additionally, we performed a T2-weighted and DTI-sequences. The parameters used were, FOV: 200 x 200 mm, slice thickness: 2 mm, and acquisition matrix: 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm. Axial MRI was carried out using a 32 gradient direction and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2 and b-value of 800 s/mm². The scanning time was less than 9 min. The DTI-data obtained were processed using a FDA approved surgical navigation system program which uses a straightforward fiber-tracking approach known as fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT). This is based on the propagation of lines between regions of interest (ROI) which is defined by a physician. A maximum angle of 50, FA start value of 0.10 and ADC stop value of 0.20 mm²/s were the parameters used for tractography. There are some limitations to this technique. The limited acquisition time frame enforces trade-offs in the image quality. Another important point not to be neglected is the brain shift during surgery. As for the latter intra-operative MRI might be helpful. Furthermore the risk of false positive or false negative tracts needs to be taken into account which might compromise the final results.},

Glioma growth is modeled via nonlinear reaction-advection-diffusion, with a two-way coupling with the underlying tissue elastic deformation. Tumor bulk and infiltration and subsequent mass-effects are not regarded separately, but captured by the model itself in the course of its evolution, Our formulation is fully Eulerian and naturally allows for updating the tumor diffusion coefficient following structural displacements caused by tumor growth/infiltration. We show that model parameters can be estimated via optimization based on imaging data, using efficient solution algorithms on regular grids. We test the model and the automatic optimization framework on real brain tumor data sets, achieving significant improvement in landmark prediction compared to a simplified purely mechanical approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract = {Object. A growing number of published studies have recently demonstrated the role of resection in overall survival (OS) for patients with gliomas. In this retrospective study, the authors objectively investigated the role of the extent of resection (EOR) in OS in patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs). Methods. Between 1998 and 2011, 190 patients underwent surgery for LGGs. All surgical procedures were conducted under corticosubcortical stimulation. The EOR was established by analyzing the pre- and postoperative volumes of the gliomas on T2-weighted MRI studies. The difference between the preoperative tumor volumes was also investigated by measuring the volumetric difference between the T2- and T1-weighted MRI images (ΔVT2T1) to evaluate how the diffusive tumor-growing pattern affected the EOR achieved. Results. The median preoperative tumor volume was 55 cm3, and in almost half of the patients the EOR was greater than 90\%. In this study, patients with an EOR of 90\% or greater had an estimated 5-year OS rate of 93\%, those with EOR between 70\% and 89\% had a 5-year OS rate of 84\%, and those with EOR less than 70\% had a 5-year OS rate of 41\% (p {$<$} 0.001). New postoperative deficits were noted in 43.7\% of cases, while permanent deficits occurred in 3.16\% of cases. There were 41 deaths (21.6\%), and the median follow-up was 4.7 years. A further volumetric analysis was also conducted to compare 2 different intraoperative protocols (Series 1 [intraoperative electrical stimulation alone] vs Series 2 [intraoperative stimulation plus overlap of functional MRI/fiber tracking diffusion tensor imaging data on a neuronavigation system]). Patients in Series 1 had a median EOR of 77\%, while those in Series 2 had a median EOR of 90\% (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that OS is influenced not only by EOR (p = 0.001) but also by age (p = 0.003), histological subtype (p = 0.005), and the ΔVT2T1 value (p {$<$} 0.0001). Progression-free survival is similarly influenced by histological subtype (fibrillary astrocytoma, p = 0.003), EOR (p {$<$} 0.0001), and ΔVT2T1 value (p {$<$} 0.0001), as is malignant progression-free survival (p = 0.003, p {$<$} 0.0001, and p {$<$} 0.0001, respectively). Finally, the study shows that the higher the ΔVT2T1 value, the less extensive the currently possible resection, highlighting an apparent correlation between the ΔVT2T1 value itself and EOR (p {$<$} 0.0001). Conclusions. The EOR and the ΔVT2T1 values are the strongest independent predictors in improving OS as well as in delaying tumor progression and malignant transformation. Furthermore, the ΔVT2T1 value may be useful as a predictive index for EOR. Finally, due to intraoperative corticosubcortical mapping and the overlap of functional data on the neuronavigation system, major resection is possible with an acceptable risk and a significant increase in expected OS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Eloquent diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGGs) threaten patients' neurologic function and are also associated with inferior survival. Many neurosurgeons still refrain from early resection due to the fear of iatrogenic neurologic injury. However, the perceived safety of expectant management strategies may soon be overshadowed by the progressive deficits of tumor growth in eloquent regions. It is also known that radical and successful surgery prolongs progression-free survival, overall survival, and may reduce seizure burden and also potentially neurocognitive functions. Thus early successful surgery with preservation of function has a significant impact on patients' health. In modern neurosurgery, safe resection is often possible with detailed knowledge of anatomy and function together with the active use of various intraoperative surgical tools. We present illustrative cases of eloquent LGGs treated with different intraoperative tools. METHODS: An introduction to important intraoperative tools in LGG surgery is provided by experts in the field and described in five cases viewed in the context of the recent LGG literature. RESULTS: We present five cases with presumed eloquently located LGGs where extensive resection was offered using different intraoperative techniques. The clinical and radiologic outcomes are described. CONCLUSIONS: Correct use of intraoperative tools together with the surgeon's knowledge of anatomy and function will provide good functional and oncologic results in eloquently located LGGs. Watchful waiting or deferral of surgery due to tumor location (i.e., claiming inoperability) is very rarely good practice. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.},

Surgical treatment is by nature highly personalized and outcome prediction is very complex. To engage and succeed in this balancing act it is important to make best use of the information available to the neurosurgeon. Areas covered: This narrative review provides an update on advancements in predicting outcomes in patients with glioma that are relevant to neurosurgeons. Expert opinion: The classical ‘gut feeling’ is notoriously unreliable and better prediction strategies for patients with glioma are warranted. There are numerous tools readily available for the neurosurgeon in predicting tumor biology and survival. Predicting extent of resection, functional outcome, and quality of life remains difficult. Although machine-learning approaches are currently not readily available in daily clinical practice, there are several ongoing efforts with the use of big data sets that are likely to create new prediction models and refine the existing models.},

Tumors arising in the brainstem were once uniformly discounted as surgically unresectable lesions. Early neurosurgeons thought this location to be inoperable and fraught with disaster. The advent of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and sophisticated neurophysiological monitoring techniques have significantly advanced the surgical treatment of these precarious lesions. REVIEW: Brainstem gliomas are now recognized as a heterogenous group of tumors. They have been broadly classified into several categories depending upon the classification scheme. All these classification systems provide a framework to predict growth patterns, surgical resectability, and overall prognosis of these tumors. These systems allow the surgeon to obtain a better understanding of the distinction between low-grade tumors and diffuse inoperable tumor types.

  abstract = {Stereovision is an important intraoperative imaging technique that captures the exposed parenchymal surface noninvasively during open cranial surgery. Estimating cortical surface shift efficiently and accurately is critical to compensate for brain deformation in the operating room (OR). In this study, we present an automatic and robust registration technique based on optical flow (OF) motion tracking to compensate for cortical surface displacement throughout surgery. Stereo images of the cortical surface were acquired at multiple time points after dural opening to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) texture intensity-encoded cortical surfaces. A local coordinate system was established with its z-axis parallel to the average surface normal direction of the reconstructed cortical surface immediately after dural opening in order to produce two-dimensional (2D) projection images. A dense displacement field between the two projection images was determined directly from OF motion tracking without the need for feature identification or tracking. The starting and end points of the displacement vectors on the two cortical surfaces were then obtained following spatial mapping inversion to produce the full 3D displacement of the exposed cortical surface. We evaluated the technique with images obtained from digital phantoms and 18 surgical cases - 10 of which involved independent measurements of feature locations acquired with a tracked stylus for accuracy comparisons, and 8 others of which 4 involved stereo image acquisitions at three or more time points during surgery to illustrate utility throughout a procedure. Results from the digital phantom images were very accurate (0.05. pixels). In the 10 surgical cases with independently digitized point locations, the average agreement between feature coordinates derived from the cortical surface reconstructions was 1.7-2.1. mm relative to those determined with the tracked stylus probe. The agreement in feature displacement tracking was also comparable to tracked probe data (difference in displacement magnitude was {$<$}1. mm on average). The average magnitude of cortical surface displacement was 7.9 ± 5.7. mm (range 0.3-24.4. mm) in all patient cases with the displacement components along gravity being 5.2 ± 6.0. mm relative to the lateral movement of 2.4 ± 1.6. mm. Thus, our technique appears to be sufficiently accurate and computationally efficiency (typically \textasciitilde 15. s), for applications in the OR. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging metrics of peritumoral edema can be used to differentiate intra- from extraaxial lesions, metastatic lesions from gliomas, and high- from low-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, diffusion-tensor MR imaging was performed preoperatively in 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms, including meningiomas, metastatic lesions, glioblastomas multiforme, and low-grade gliomas. Histograms of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were used to analyze both the tumor and the associated T2 signal intensity abnormality. An additional metric, the tumor infiltration index (TII), was evaluated. The TII is a measure of the change in FA presumably caused by tumor cells infiltrating the peritumoral edema. Student t test and least-squares linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Peritumoral MD and FA values indicated no statistically significant difference between intra- and extraaxial lesions or between high- and low-grade gliomas. Regarding intraaxial tumors, the measured mean peritumoral MD of metastatic lesions, 0.733 × 10 -3 mm2/sec ± 0.061 (SD), was significantly higher than that of gliomas, 0.587 ± 0.093 × 10-3 mm 2/sec (P {$<$} .05). There was also a statistically significant difference between the TIIs of the edema surrounding meningiomas and metastases (mean, 0 ± 35) and the TIIs of the edema surrounding gliomas (mean, 64 ± 59) (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSION: Peritumoral diffusion-tensor MR imaging metrics enable the differentiation of solitary intraaxial metastatic brain tumors from gliomas. In addition, the TII enables one to distinguish presumed tumor-infiltrated edema from purely vasogenic edema. © RSNA, 2004.},

For both patients, diagnosis of lymphoma was impossible without histological examination because of the rarity of the lymphoma location. The first case involved an 84-year-old woman who developed loss of vision and hypopituitarism. Intraoperative finding was optic glioma; histological diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma, however. The second case involved a 67-year-old man who developed loss of vision. The pre-surgical diagnosis was optic nerve neuritis; this was then revised to granuloma. The tumor arose in the optic nerve. Methotrexate and rituximab were administered and the patient remained in complete remission for 3 years. However, a sudden intratumoral hemorrhage occurred. Although most of the lymphoma cells obtained from the initial surgery were negative for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunoreactivity, high levels of VEGF immunoreactivity in lymphoma cells was detected in the specimen obtained after intratumoral bleeding at recurrence, and correlation between VEGF reactivity and tumor recurrence was suggested. To date, primary CNS lymphomas with intracerebral hemorrhage have been reported in 3 cases only, and a correlation between intratumoral hemorrhage and the degree of VEGF expression has been suggested. VEGF also might have predictive significance for recurrence.},

  abstract = {Object. With recent advances in the adjuvant treatment of malignant brain astrocytomas, it is increasingly debated whether extent of resection affects survival. In this study, the authors investigate this issue after primary and revision resection of these lesions. Methods. The authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of 1215 patients who underwent surgery for malignant brain astrocytomas (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade III or IV) at a single institution from 1996 to 2006. Patients with deep-seated or unresectable lesions were excluded. Based on MR imaging results obtained {$<$} 48 hours after surgery, gross-total resection (GTR) was defined as no residual enhancement, near-total resection (NTR) as having thin rim enhancement of the resection cavity only, and subtotal resection (STR) as having residual nodular enhancement. The independent association of extent of resection and subsequent survival was assessed via a multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis. Results. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were available for review in 949 cases. The mean age and mean Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score at time of surgery were 51 ± 16 years and 80 ± 10, respectively. Surgery consisted of primary resection in 549 patients (58\%) and revision resection for tumor recurrence in 400 patients (42\%). The lesion was WHO Grade IV in 700 patients (74\%) and Grade III in 249 (26\%); there were 167 astrocytomas and 82 mixed oligoastrocytoma. Among patients who underwent resection, GTR, NTR, and STR were achieved in 330 (35\%), 388 (41\%), and 231 cases (24\%), respectively. Adjusting for factors associated with survival (for example, age, KPS score, Gliadel and/or temozolomide use, and subsequent resection), GTR versus NTR (p {$<$} 0.05) and NTR versus STR (p {$<$} 0.05) were independently associated with improved survival after both primary and revision resection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For primary GBM resection, the median survival after GTR, NTR, and STR was 13, 11, and 8 months, respectively. After revision resection, the median survival after GTR, NTR, and STR was 11, 9, and 5 months, respectively. Adjusting for factors associated with survival for WHO Grade III astrocytoma (age, KPS score, and revision resection), GTR versus STR (p {$<$} 0.05) was associated with improved survival. Gross-total resection versus NTR was not associated with an independent survival benefit in patients with WHO Grade III astrocytomas. The median survival after primary resection of WHO Grade III (mixed oligoastrocytomas excluded) for GTR, NTR, and STR was 58, 46, and 34 months, respectively. Conclusions. In the authors' experience with both primary and secondary resection of malignant brain astrocytomas, increasing extent of resection was associated with improved survival independent of age, degree of disability, WHO grade, or subsequent treatment modalities used. The maximum extent of resection should be safely attempted while minimizing the risk of surgically induced neurological injury.},

  abstract = {An approach to the deformable registration of three-dimensional brain tumor images to a normal brain atlas is presented. The approach involves the integration of three components: a biomechanical model of tumor mass-effect, a statistical approach to estimate the model's parameters, and a deformable image registration method. Statistical properties of the sought deformation map from the atlas to the image of a tumor patient are first obtained through tumor mass-effect simulations on normal brain images. This map is decomposed into the sum of two components in orthogonal subspaces, one representing inter-individual differences in brain shape, and the other representing tumor-induced deformation. For a new tumor case, a partial observation of the sought deformation map is obtained via deformable image registration and is decomposed into the aforementioned spaces in order to estimate the mass-effect model parameters. Using this estimate, a simulation of tumor mass-effect is performed on the atlas image in order to generate an image that is similar to tumor patient's image, thereby facilitating the atlas registration process. Results for a real tumor case and a number of simulated tumor cases indicate significant reduction in the registration error due to the presented approach as compared to the direct use of deformable image registration. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Modern neuronavigation systems lack spatial accuracy during ongoing surgical procedures because of increasing brain deformation, known as brain shift. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used for quantitative analysis and visualization of this phenomenon. METHODS: For a total of 64 patients, we used a 0.2-T, open-configuration, magnetic resonance imaging scanner, located in an operating theater, for pre- and intraoperative imaging. The three-dimensional imaging data were aligned using rigid registration methods. The maximal displacements of the brain surface, deep tumor margin, and midline structures were measured. Brain shift was observed in two-dimensional image planes using split-screen or overlay techniques, and three-dimensional, color-coded, deformable surface-based data were computed. In selected cases, intraoperative images were transferred to the neuronavigation system to compensate for the effects of brain shift. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that there was great variability in brain shift, ranging up to 24 mm for cortical displacement and exceeding 3 mm for the deep tumor margin in 66\% of all cases. Brain shift was influenced by tissue characteristics, intraoperative patient positioning, opening of the ventricular system, craniotomy size, and resected volume. Intraoperative neuronavigation updating (n = 14) compensated for brain shift, resulting in reliable navigation with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: Without brain shift compensation, neuronavigation systems cannot be trusted at critical steps of the surgical procedure, e.g., identification of the deep tumor margin. Intraoperative imaging allows not only evaluation of and compensation for brain shift but also assessment of the quality of mathematical models that attempt to describe and compensate for brain shift.},

  abstract = {Fetal ventriculomegaly refers to a condition in which there is enlargement of the ventricular spaces, typically on prenatal ultrasound. It can be associated with other CNS or extra-CNS abnormalities, and this relationship is crucial to understand as it affects overall neonatal outcome. Isolated ventriculomegaly has been described in the literature with variable clinical outcome. Typically, outcome is based on the etiology and degree of ventriculomegaly. When associated with a pathologic condition, ventriculomegaly can be a result of hydrocephalus. While initial diagnosis is usually made on prenatal ultrasound, fetal magnetic resonance imaging is preferred to further elucidate any associated CNS malformations. In this paper, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive review of the diagnosis, associated etiologies, prognosis, and treatment options related to fetal, neonatal, and pediatric ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus. In addition, preliminary data is provided from our institutional cohort of patients with a prenatal diagnosis of ventriculomegaly followed through the perinatal period.},

  abstract = {Obtaining validation data and comparison metrics for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) are difficult tasks due to the lack of reliable ground truth. This problem is even more evident for images presenting pathology, which can both alter tissue appearance through infiltration and cause geometric distortions. Systems for generating synthetic images with user-defined degradation by noise and intensity inhomogeneity offer the possibility for testing and comparison of segmentation methods. Such systems do not yet offer simulation of sufficiently realistic looking pathology. This paper presents a system that combines physical and statistical modeling to generate synthetic multi-modal 3D brain MRI with tumor and edema, along with the underlying anatomical ground truth, Main emphasis is placed on simulation of the major effects known for tumor MRI, such as contrast enhancement, local distortion of healthy tissue, infiltrating edema adjacent to tumors, destruction and deformation of fiber tracts, and multi-modal MRI contrast of healthy tissue and pathology. The new method synthesizes pathology in multi-modal MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by simulating mass effect, warping and destruction of white matter fibers, and infiltration of brain tissues by tumor cells. We generate synthetic contrast enhanced MR images by simulating the accumulation of contrast agent within the brain. The appearance of the the brain tissue and tumor in MRI is simulated by synthesizing texture images from real MR images. The proposed method is able to generate synthetic ground truth and synthesized MR images with tumor and edema that exhibit comparable segmentation challenges to real tumor MRI. Such image data sets will find use in segmentation reliability studies, comparison and validation of different segmentation methods, training and teaching, or even in evaluating standards for tumor size like the RECIST criteria (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Three- dimensional feature tracking and two-dimensional image analysis of the cortical surface were used to quantify the observed motion. Data acquisition was facilitated by a ceiling-mounted robotic platform, which provided a number of precision tracking capabilities. The patient's head position and the size and orientation of the craniotomy were recorded at the start of surgery. Error analysis demonstrated that the surface displacement measuring methodology was accurate to 1 to 2 mm. Statistical tests were performed to examine correlations between the amount of displacement and the type of surgery, the nature of the cranial opening, the region of the brain involved, the duration of surgery, and the degree of invasiveness. RESULTS: The results showed that a displacement of an average of 1 cm occurred, with the dominant directional component being associated with gravity. The mean displacement was determined to be independent of the size and orientation of the cranial opening. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that loss of spatial registration with preoperative images is gravity-dominated and of sufficient extent that attention to errors resulting from misregistration during the course of surgery is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background. Patients with an advanced-stage glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) often show general motor, gait, and cognitive deterioration. Some have radiological evidence of ventriculomegaly, but the relevance of this to their symptoms may be unclear. Distinction between tumour patients who have dilated fluid spaces as a consequence of tissue loss from surgery or treatment, and those who have a symptomatic hydrocephalic process, one who may gain benefit from insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, is an important clinical challenge. Methods. From a series of 530 GBM patients treated by a single surgeon (ZR), we retrospectively reviewed 16 patients with advanced-stage GBM who had presented with non-obstructive ventriculomegaly and clinical deterioration not explained by progressive disease. Each had been treated by insertion of a ventriculo- peritoneal shunt (VPS). Assessments included clinical features, Karnofsky Performance Scale, motor and cognitive findings, complications and survival. Findings. Ten patients benefited from insertion of the shunt, with moderate to significant cognitive improvement. Of seven patients who presented with motor symptoms, such as gait instability, general weakness, and slowness, four patients showed significant motor improvement in addition to major cognitive improvement. Early infectious complication occurred in five patients; a late shunt infection in one; one patient had symptoms related to overdrainage; and in another a mechanical shunt malfunction occurred. Three patients died from shunt-related complications. Conclusions. Insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt can improve cognitive and motor function in a small subset of patients with advanced-stage glioblastoma multiforme and ventriculomegaly. Infection is a major risk in this patient population. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

Mean age at diagnosis is 41 for grade A and 45 1/2 for grade B, epilepsy being the main revealing symptom (91.5\% of A, 76\% of B). Survival at 5, 10 and 15 years is respectively 75.5\%, 51\% and 22.4\% for grade A (median: 136 months), and 45.2\%, 31.3\% and 0\% for grade B (median: 52 months). It is influenced by age at diagnosis: median, before 40 years of age, is 12 years for A and 8 1/2 for B; between 40 and 60, is 12 years for A and 4 1/2 for B; over 60, is 4 years for A and 1 1/2 for B. In children, they represent less than 2.5\% of cerebral tumors and include 23\% grade A and 77\% grade B (48.5\% WHO grade II and 51.5\% WHO grade III). Mean age at surgical removal is 9.5 +/- 5 years. One third are hemispheric, 2/3 are revealed by epilepsy. A complete surgical removal is performed in 60\%. Mean survival is 13 years (154 +/- 20 months), with a mortality at 5 and 10 years of 60\% +/- 9\%, and a risk of recurrence of 54\% +/- 9\% at 5 years and 46.5\% +/- 10.5\% at 5 years. The main differential diagnosis of grade A oligo is dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT). Inversely, thalamic locations, most often grade B, generally present with a motor deficit; complete removal can be achieved in only 15\%. The only efficient treatment is chemotherapy, requiring search for chemosensitivity (1p19q deletion, expression of MGMT gene, analysis by MR-spectroscopy and TEP). Logically, surgical debulking should be as wide as possible, but with preservation of neurological and cognitive functions with the help of modern imaging progresses (fMRI, diffusion and perfusion MRI, tractography, PET) and operative techniques (navigation, cortical stimulation, and even opertaive MRI). Tumors presenting clinical and radiological progression should be removed. Operative mortality varies from 0 to 6\%, transient morbidity from 20 to 25\%, definit morbidity from 5 to 10\%. Radiotherapy does not significantly modify survival whatever the delivered dose. The important point is the patient's radiosensitivity: survival is 148 months for radiosensitive patients versus 12 months for non responsive patients. Studies and development of pretherapeutic assays of tumoral radiosensitivity will be a fundamental research axis (PET, sample studies). © Masson, Paris, 2005.},

  abstract = {Objective: The optimal therapeutic approach to craniopharyngioma has not been established conclusively. The surgical outcome following radical excision and conservative resection with adjuvant radiotherapy are comparable or even better with the later in pediatric or mixed populations. This study is aimed at reviewing the role of extent of resection in local tumor control and long-term outcome in adults with craniopharyngioma. Patients and methods: Ninety-five adults operated between 2001 and 2013 were included. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Predictors of various outcome parameters were analyzed. Results: The predominant presenting symptom was visual impairment (78 \%) followed by symptoms of hypothalamic involvement (29 \%). Total and subtotal excisions (TE, STE) were achieved in 63 \%, and 47 \% of patients, respectively. Vision improved in 62 \% of patients in the early postoperative period. Thirteen patients (14 \%) experienced vision deterioration postoperatively. On multivariate analysis, tumor {$>$}3 cm and optic atrophy predicted poor visual outcome. Hormonal replacement for hypopituitarism was required in 83 \% during follow-up. Diabetes insipidus was seen in 73 \%. Imaging evidence of 3rd ventricular floor destruction by tumor emerged as an independent predictor of postoperative hypothalamic morbidities. The recurrence rate following TE and STE was 11.6 \% and 72 \%, respectively. Unlike radical excision, PFS following STE was significantly shorter (p- 0.02). TE was not associated with increased visual impairment or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction postoperatively as compared to STE. Most of the patients (85 \%) were independent and able to return to the premorbid occupation. Conclusion: Subtotal resection provides equally good long-term visual, endocrinological, and hypothalamic outcomes as radical surgery. When used with adjuvant radiotherapy, it also gives a better local control of the tumor. Hence, subtotal resection with adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered as an effective alternative strategy to radical excision.},

RESULTS: Twenty-eight high-grade glioma articles and 10 low-grade glioma articles were examined in terms of quality of evidence, expected extent of resection, and survival benefit. CONCLUSION: Despite persistent limitations in the quality of data, mounting evidence suggests that more extensive surgical resection is associated with longer life expectancy for both low-and high-grade gliomas.},

  abstract = {Background: Intraoperative MRI is increasingly used in neurosurgery, although there is little evidence for its use. We aimed to assess efficacy of intraoperative MRI guidance on extent of resection in patients with glioma. Methods: In our prospective, randomised, parallel-group trial, we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with contrast enhancing gliomas amenable to radiologically complete resection who presented to Goethe University (Frankfurt, Germany). We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with computer-generated blocks of four and a sealed-envelope design to undergo intraoperative MRI-guided surgery or conventional microsurgery (control group). Surgeons and patients were unmasked to treatment group allocation, but an independent neuroradiologist was masked during analysis of all preoperative and postoperative imaging data. The primary endpoint was rate of complete resections as established by early postoperative high-field MRI (1·5 T or 3·0 T). Analysis was done per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01394692. Findings: We enrolled 58 patients between Oct 1, 2007, and July 1, 2010. 24 (83\%) of 29 patients randomly allocated to the intraoperative MRI group and 25 (86\%) of 29 controls were eligible for analysis (four patients in each group had metastasis and one patient in the intraoperative MRI group withdrew consent after randomisation). More patients in the intraoperative MRI group had complete tumour resection (23 [96\%] of 24 patients) than did in the control group (17 [68\%] of 25, p=0·023). Postoperative rates of new neurological deficits did not differ between patients in the intraoperative MRI group (three [13\%] of 24) and controls (two [8\%] of 25, p=1·0). No patient for whom use of intraoperative MRI led to continued resection of residual tumour had neurological deterioration. One patient in the control group died before 6 months. Interpretation: Our study provides evidence for the use of intraoperative MRI guidance in glioma surgery: such imaging helps surgeons provide the optimum extent of resection.

  abstract = {Purpose: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), routinely collected as a part of cancer clinical trials, have been linked with survival in numerous clinical studies, but a comprehensive critical review has not been reported. This study systematically assessed the impact of PROs on patient survival after a cancer diagnosis within the context of clinical trials. Design: Cancer clinical trials that assessed baseline PROs and mortality were identified through MEDLINE (through December 2006) supplemented by the Cochrane database, American Society of Clinical Oncology/European Society for Medical Oncology abstracts and hand searches. Inclusion criteria were publication in English language and use of multivariate analyses of PROs that controlled for one or more clinical factors. Two raters reviewed each study, abstracted data, and assessed study quality; two additional raters verified abstractions. Results: In 36 of 39 studies (N = 13,874), at least one PRO was significantly associated with survival (P {$<$} .05) in multivariate analysis, with varying effect sizes. Studies of lung (n = 12) and breast cancer (n = 8) were most prevalent. The most commonly assessed PRO was quality of life, measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 in 56\% of studies. Clinical variables adjusted for included performance status (PS), treatment arm, stage, weight loss, and serum markers. Results indicated that PROs provide distinct prognostic information beyond standard clinical measures in cancer clinical trials. Conclusion: PROs might be considered for stratification purposes in future trials, as they were often better predictors of survival than PS. Studies are needed to determine whether interventions that improve PROs also increase survival and to identify explanatory mechanisms through which PROs relate to survival. © 2008 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this paper we introduce a finite element-based strategy for simulation of brain deformation occurring during neurosurgery. The phenomenon, known as brain shift, causes a decrease in the accuracy of neuronavigation systems that rely on preoperatively acquired data. This can be compensated for with a computational model of the brain deformation process. By applying model calculations to preoperative images, an update within the operating room can be performed. METHODS: One of the crucial concerns in the context of developing a physical-based model is the choice of governing equations describing the physics of the phenomenon. In this work, deformation of brain tissue is expressed in terms of a 3D consolidation model for a linearly elastic and porous fluid. The next crucial issue is ensuring stable calculations within the chosen model. For this purpose, we developed a special technique for generating the underlying geometry for the simulation. With this technique an unstructured grid consisting of regular tetrahedra is created, whereupon time-dependent finite element simulation is performed in an adaptive manner. RESULTS: We applied our algorithm to preoperative MR scans and investigated the value of the method. Due to the adaptivity of the method, only 5-10\% of the computing time was needed as compared to traditional finite element approaches based on a uniformly subdivided grid. The results of the experiments were compared to the corresponding intraoperative MR scans. A close match between the computed deformation of the brain and the displacement resulting from the intraoperative data was observed. CONCLUSION: A model-based approach for the simulation of brain shift is presented. In this computational model the brain tissue is described as an elastic and porous material using Biot consolidation theory. Validating experiments conducted with MR data provided promising results.},

  abstract = {In this work a new method for the determination of the mechanical properties of brain tissue is introduced. Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio v are iteratively estimated based on a finite element model for brain shift and on the information contained in pre- and intraoperative MR data after registration. In each iteration, a 3D dataset is generated according to the displacement vector field resulting from a numerical simulation of the intraoperative brain deformation. This reconstruction is parametrized by elastic moduli of tissue. They are automatically varied in order to achieve the best correspondence between the grey value distribution in the reconstructed image and the intensity entropy in the MR image of the brain undergoing deformation. This work contributes to the difficult problem of defining correct mechanical parameters to perform reliable model calculations of brain deformation. Proper boundary conditions that are crucial in this context are also addressed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Early and aggressive resection of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) leads to increased overall patient survival, decreased malignant progression, and better seizure control. This case series describes the authors' approach to achieving optimal neurological and surgical outcomes in patients referred by outside neurosurgeons for stereotactic biopsy of tumors believed to be complex or a high surgical risk, due to their diffuse nature on neuroimaging and their obvious infiltration of functional cortex. METHODS: Seven patients underwent individualized neuroimaging evaluation preoperatively, which included routine brain MRI with and without contrast administration for intraoperative neuronavigation, functional MRI with speech and motor mapping, diffusion tensor imaging to delineate white matter tracts, and MR perfusion to identify potential foci of higher grade malignancy within the tumor. Awake craniotomy with intraoperative motor and speech mapping was performed in all patients. Tumor removal was initiated through a transsylvian approach for insular lesions, and through multiple corticotomies in stimulation-confirmed noneloquent areas for all other lesions. Resection was continued until neuronavigation indicated normal brain, cortical or subcortical stimulation revealed functional cortex, or the patient began to experience a minor neurological deficit on intraoperative testing. RESULTS: Gross-total resection was achieved in 1 patient and subtotal resection ({$>$} 80\%) in 6 patients, as assessed by postoperative MRI. Over the average follow-up duration of 31 months, no patient experienced a progression or recurrence. Long-term seizure control was excellent in 6 patients who achieved Engel Class I outcomes. Neurologically, all 7 patients experienced mild temporary deficits or seizures that completely resolved, and 1 patient continues to have mild expressive aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: Significant resection of diffuse, infiltrating LGGs is possible, even in presumed eloquent cortex. Aggressive resection maximizes seizure control and does not necessarily cause permanent neurological deficits. Individualized preoperative neuroimaging evaluation, including tractography and awake craniotomy with intraoperative speech and motor mapping, is an essential tool in achieving these outcomes.},

  abstract = {Although a variety of diffeomorphic deformable registration methods exist in the literature, application of these methods in the presence of space-occupying lesions is not straightforward. The motivation of this work is spatial normalization of MR images from patients with brain tumors in a common stereotaxic space, aiming to pool data from different patients into a common space in order to perform group analyses. Additionally, transfer of structural and functional information from neuroanatomical brain atlases into the individual patient's space can be achieved via the inverse mapping, for the purpose of segmenting brains and facilitating surgical or radiotherapy treatment planning. A method that estimates the brain tissue loss and replacement by tumor is applied for achieving equivalent image content between an atlas and a patient's scan, based on a biomechanical model of tumor growth. Automated estimation of the parameters modeling brain tissue loss and displacement is performed via optimization of an objective function reflecting feature-based similarity and elastic stretching energy, which is optimized in parallel via APPSPACK (Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search). The results of the method, applied to 21 brain tumor patients, indicate that the registration accuracy is relatively high in areas around the tumor, as well as in the healthy portion of the brain. Also, the calculated deformation in the vicinity of the tumor is shown to correlate highly with expert-defined visual scores indicating the tumor mass effect, thereby potentially leading to an objective approach to quantification of mass effect, which is commonly used in diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.
