The introduction of diffusion magnetic resonance tractography at the end of the 20th century allowed researchers and clinicians the ability to conduct large-scale studies into white matter connectivity, laterality, and subdivision over large subject sets and to a high level of accuracy previously unavailable by postmortem techniques. In this chapter, we explore the application of tractography to the study of white matter neuroanatomy. We further discuss tractographic contributions to the understanding of the anatomy of major white matter systems (projection, association, limbic, commissural, and cranial nerves).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Warning criteria for monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP) after direct cortical stimulation during surgery for supratentorial tumors have been well described. However, little is known about the value of MEP after transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in predicting postoperative motor deficit when monitoring threshold level. The authors aimed to evaluate the feasibility and value of this method in glioma surgery by using a new approach for interpreting changes in threshold level involving contra- and ipsilateral MEP. METHODS Between November 2013 and December 2014, 93 patients underwent TES-MEP monitoring during resection of gliomas located close to central motor pathways but not involving the primary motor cortex. The MEP were elicited by transcranial repetitive anodal train stimulation. Bilateral MEP were continuously evaluated to assess percentage increase of threshold level (minimum voltage needed to evoke a stable motor response from each of the muscles being monitored) from the baseline set before dural opening. An increase in threshold level on the contralateral side (facial, arm, or leg muscles contralateral to the affected hemisphere) of more than 20\% beyond the percentage increase on the ipsilateral side (facial, arm, or leg muscles ipsilateral to the affected hemisphere) was considered a significant alteration. Recorded alterations were subsequently correlated with postoperative neurological deterioration and MRI findings. RESULTS TES-MEP could be elicited in all patients, including those with recurrent glioma (31 patients) and preoperative paresis (20 patients). Five of 73 patients without preoperative paresis showed a significant increase in threshold level, and all of them developed new paresis postoperatively (transient in 4 patients and permanent in 1 patient). Eight of 20 patients with preoperative paresis showed a significant increase in threshold level, and all of them developed postoperative neurological deterioration (transient in 4 patients and permanent in 4 patients). In 80 patients no significant change in threshold level was detected, and none of them showed postoperative neurological deterioration. The specificity and sensitivity in this series were estimated at 100\%. Postoperative MRI revealed gross-total tumor resection in 56 of 82 patients (68\%) in whom complete tumor resection was attainable; territorial ischemia was detected in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS The novel threshold criterion has made TES-MEP a useful method for predicting postoperative motor deficit in patients who undergo glioma surgery, and has been feasible in patients with preoperative paresis as well as in patients with recurrent glioma. Including contra- and ipsilateral changes in threshold level has led to a high sensitivity and specificity.}

  abstract = {Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex nonlinear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong–Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters that can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.},

Previous diffusion tensor (DT) MRI studies showed a more ventral white matter (WM) involvement in SV patients and a more widespread frontal involvement in NFV. Aim of this manuscript is twofold. First, we wished to provide a brief state-of-the-art review on WM damage in PPA. Second, we used DT MRI to assess the topography of WM microstructural damage along dorsal and ventral language pathways and corpus callosum in patients with NFV and SV. Our findings show that the two PPA variants share an overlapping pattern of dorsal and ventral pathway abnormalities. In addition to these common abnormalities, variant-specific WM changes were also found, with NFV patients having a more severe damage to the dorsal (fronto-parietal) WM connections within the left superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate and SV patients showing a greater left ventral tract involvement (inferior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi). These findings offer evidence that both dorsal and ventral language networks may contribute to the relatively selective deficits in NFV and SV patients.},

  abstract = {In noisy environments, our ability to understand speech benefits greatly from seeing the speaker's face. This is attributed to the brain's ability to integrate audio and visual information, a process known as multisensory integration. In addition, selective attention plays an enormous role in what we understand, the so-called cocktail-party phenomenon. But how attention and multisensory integration interact remains incompletely understood, particularly in the case of natural, continuous speech. Here, we addressed this issue by analyzing EEG data recorded from participants who undertook a multisensory cocktail-party task using natural speech. To assess multisensory integration, we modeled the EEG responses to the speech in two ways. The first assumed that audiovisual speech processing is simply a linear combination of audio speech processing and visual speech processing (i.e., an A~+~V model), while the second allows for the possibility of audiovisual interactions (i.e., an AV model). Applying these models to the data revealed that EEG responses to attended audiovisual speech were better explained by an AV model, providing evidence for multisensory integration. In contrast, unattended audiovisual speech responses were best captured using an A~+~V model, suggesting that multisensory integration is suppressed for unattended speech. Follow up analyses revealed some limited evidence for early multisensory integration of unattended AV speech, with no integration occurring at later levels of processing. We take these findings as evidence that the integration of natural audio and visual speech occurs at multiple levels of processing in the brain, each of which can be differentially affected by attention.},

  abstract = {Objective: The present study analyzed the benefits of the use of tractography in the preoperative and intraoperative scenarios. Methods: We present a prospective cohort study with 2 groups of patients who had undergone awake surgery for brain tumor resection. A control group for which no intraoperative navigated diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used (non-DTI group) and the case group (DTI group). The operative time, complete tumor resection, and neurological postoperative deficits were measured as primary outcomes. A secondary analysis was performed to determine the power of preoperative DTI to predict for complete tumor resection. Results: A total of 37 patients were included, 18 in the non-DTI group and 19 in the DTI group. No differences were found between the 2 groups for sex, mean age, tumor histological findings, and preoperative mean tumor volume. The awake surgical time in the non-DTI group was 119.8 ± 31.1 minutes and 93.6 ± 12.2 minutes in the DTI group (P = 0.007). A trend was found toward complete tumor resection in the DTI group (P = 0.09). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting complete tumor resection were 88\% and 62.5\% for the non-DTI group and 100\% and 80\% for the DTI group, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.720 in the non-DTI group and 0.966 in the DTI group (P = 0.041). Conclusions: Intraoperative navigated tractography shortened the time of awake neuro-oncological surgery and might provide help in performing complete tumor resection. Also, tractography used in the preoperative planning could be a useful tool for better prediction of complete tumor resection.},

  abstract = {Aphasia is an acquired disorder caused by damage, most commonly due to stroke, to brain regions involved in speech and language. While language impairment is the defining symptom of aphasia, the co-occurrence of non-language cognitive deficits and their importance in predicting rehabilitation and recovery outcomes is well documented. However, people with aphasia (PWA) are rarely tested on higher-order cognitive functions, making it difficult for studies to associate these functions with a consistent lesion correlate. Broca’s area is a particular brain region of interest that has long been implicated in speech and language production. Contrary to classic models of speech and language, cumulative evidence shows that Broca’s area and surrounding regions in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC) are involved in, but not specific to, speech production. In this study we aimed to explore the brain-behaviour relationships between tests of cognitive skill and language abilities in thirty-six adults with long-term speech production deficits caused by post-stroke aphasia. Our findings suggest that non-linguistic cognitive functions, namely executive functions and verbal working memory, explain more of the behavioural variance in PWA than classical language models imply. Additionally, lesions to the LIFC, including Broca’s area, were associated with non-linguistic executive (dys)function, suggesting that lesions to this area are associated with non-language-specific higher-order cognitive deficits in aphasia. Whether executive (dys)function – and its neural correlate in Broca’s area – contributes directly to PWA’s language production deficits or simply co-occurs with it, adding to communication difficulties, remains unclear. These findings support contemporary models of speech production that place language processing within the context of domain-general perception, action and conceptual knowledge. An understanding of the covariance between language and non-language deficits and their underlying neural correlates will inform better targeted aphasia treatment and outcomes.},

  abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model of MRI signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor MRI imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of applying spatial transformations (or "image warps") to diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. The orientational information that these images contain must be handled appropriately when they are transformed spatially during image registration. We present solutions for global transformations of three-dimensional images up to 12-parameter affine complexity and indicate how our methods can be extended for higher order transformations. Several approaches are presented and tested using synthetic data. One method, the preservation of principal direction algorithm, which takes into account shearing, stretching and rigid rotation, is shown to be the most effective. Additional registration experiments are performed on human brain data obtained from a single subject, whose head was imaged in three different orientations within the scanner. All of our methods improve the consistency between registered and target images over naïve warping algorithms.},

  abstract = {This work details the observation of non-Gaussian apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profiles in multi-direction, diffusion-weighted MR data acquired with easily achievable imaging parameters (b ≈ 1000 s/mm2). A technique is described for modeling the profile of the ADC over the sphere, which can capture non-Gaussian effects that can occur at, for example, intersections of different tissue types or white matter fiber tracts. When these effects are significant, the common diffusion tensor model is inappropriate, since it is based on the assumption of a simple underlying diffusion process, which can be described by a Gaussian probability density function. A sequence of models of increasing complexity is obtained by truncating the spherical harmonic (SH) expansion of the ADC measurements at several orders. Further, a method is described for selection of the most appropriate of these models, in order to describe the data adequately but without overfitting. The combined procedure is used to classify the profile at each voxel as isotropic, anisotropic Gaussian, or non-Gaussian, each with reference to the underlying probability density function of displacement of water molecules. We use it to show that non-Gaussian profiles arise consistently in various regions of the human brain where complex tissue structure is known to exist, and can be observed in data typical of clinical scanners. The performance of the procedure developed is characterized using synthetic data in order to demonstrate that the observed effects are genuine. This characterization validates the use of our method as an indicator of pathology that affects tissue structure, which will tend to reduce the complexity of the selected model. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The review concentrates on the software implementation of the new techniques. Results of the preliminary comparison show that PASMRI recovers the principal directions of simple test functions more consistently than q-ball imaging and produces qualitatively better results on the test data set. Further simulations suggest that a moderate increase in data quality allows q-ball, which is much faster to run, to recover directions with consistency comparable to that of PASMRI on the test data. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.},

An illustration then uses the framework to study the feasibility of measuring direct features of brain-tissue microstructure in vivo. The study investigates the accuracy and precision with which we can estimate potentially important new biomarkers such as axon density and radius in white matter. Simulation experiments use a simple model of white matter based on CHARMED (composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion). The optimization finds acquisition protocols achievable on modern human and animal systems that consist of 120 measurements with fixed maximum gradient strengths. Axon radii in brain tissue are typically in the range 0.25-10 microm. Simulations suggest that estimates of radii in the range 5-10 microm have highest precision and that a maximum gradient strength of 0.07 T m(-1) is sufficient to distinguish radii of 5, 10, and 20 microm. Smaller radii are more difficult to distinguish from one another but are identifiable as small. A maximum gradient strength of 0.2 T m(-1) distinguishes radii of 1 and 2 microm. The simulations also suggest that axon densities and diffusivity parameters in the normal range for white matter are recoverable. The experiment-design optimization has applications well beyond the current work to optimize the protocol for fitting any model of the diffusion process.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new computational imaging technique called image quality transfer (IQT). IQT uses machine learning to transfer the rich information available from one-off experimental medical imaging devices to the abundant but lower-quality data from routine acquisitions. The procedure uses matched pairs to learn mappings from low-quality to corresponding high-quality images. Once learned, these mappings then augment unseen low quality images, for example by enhancing image resolution or information content. Here, we demonstrate IQT using a simple patch-regression implementation and the uniquely rich diffusion MRI data set from the human connectome project (HCP). Results highlight potential benefits of IQT in both brain connectivity mapping and microstructure imaging. In brain connectivity mapping, IQT reveals, from standard data sets, thin connection pathways that tractography normally requires specialised data to reconstruct. In microstructure imaging, IQT shows potential in estimating, from standard “single-shell” data (one non-zero b-value), maps of microstructural parameters that normally require specialised multi-shell data. Further experiments show strong generalisability, highlighting IQT's benefits even when the training set does not directly represent the application domain. The concept extends naturally to many other imaging modalities and reconstruction problems.},

Dissecting the specimens from lateral to medial we can describe 3 segments: a vertical segment that runs along the frontal lobe; an horizontal segment that runs along frontal lobe; an horizontal segment that runs from the limen insulae, passes into to the temporal stem and arrives at the parietal and occipital lobes. We retrospectively analyzed also 23 awake surgeries. 2 responses were elicited at subcortical stimulation at the third segment of the IFOF; stimulation gave paraphasias on the first segment of the IFOF in one case. All IFOF responses were founded in the left hemisphere. Anatomical knowledge is the cornerstone of surgical orientation, it allows eloquent structures to be reached quickly and it is of primary importance in awake surgery to avoid patient fatigue with lack of concentration.},

  abstract = {We do not believe that this kind of publication can have a "casual" reader; however, we are happy to clarify the issues that have been raised. The current study included routine standard microsurgical removal of glioma near the pyramidal tract with application of the prevailing gold standard which was direct electrical subcortical stimulation (DESS), MRI with sequences of T1, T2, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), DTI-based tractography, neuronavigation, neurophysiological monitoring, and intraoperative MRI. 2 Such multimodality microsurgical procedures belong to the daily work of neurosurgeons. The application of intraoperative updated tractography in a prospective design was the unique aspect of the study that facilitated precise comparison of reconstructed fiber tracts with the gold standard of DESS. The judgment about tumor boundary and surrounding white matter tract was based on the clinical decision making of the neuroradiologist, neurol-ogist, and neurosurgeon, mainly considering the gold standard (DESS). Meanwhile the pre-and intraoperative DTI tractography images, used for localization of pyramidal tract, were evaluated in comparison to the gold standard which was DESS, in the setup of a standard microsurgical procedure. 2 The limits of the deterministic algorithm are well understood and discussed in literature. 3-5 Our aim was to test such a tool, which is used in the everyday clinical practice, in a significant large number of neurosurgical departments. When deterministic tractography depicted a 3-dimensional area as corticospinal tract, the result was compared with the real images of T1-weighted MRI and fractional anisotropy (FA) color map, which already indicated neurosurgical anatomy without modification made by software. If the reconstructed DTI-based fiber tracts were far beyond the anatomical perspective, the fibers were excluded manually. Therefore, tools were "everyday methods" with all the shortcomings that others had to deal with as well. There are different approaches and algorithms employed to generate fiber tract representations , which require clear interpretations. 3-5 The challenges and variability of evaluating DTI tractography between different centers were published previously by cooperation of one of our co-authors, as referenced in the letter. 3 Significant differences exist between research tools and their clinical applications, particularly with regard to pre-and intra-operative surgical planning. 3,4 The iPlan Cranial 3.0 software (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany) is not free source as a pure research tool 4,6 ; however, it is an FDA-approved treatment planning tool. FDA approval indicates further steps that have confirmed accuracy, safety, or reliability of software to be used not only as a research but also as a treatment planning tool. 4,6 Software of DTI tractography require specific parameters to perform fiber depiction, such as the iPlan Cranial 3.0 software(Brainlab AG), which needs FA threshold, minimum fiber length, and task-based functional acquisitions as essentials for image reconstruction. 6,7 The FA threshold and minimum length of fiber tract chosen for the study were in accordance with the previous literature 8,9 and the first author performed the segmentation of the cerebral peduncle. The reliability and interobserver variability in DTI fiber tracking is an important issue; therefore, software-based automatic segmen-tation of the tracts is being established. 10 Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI is a quite standardized technique for functional MRI (fMRI), as explained in the paper. 2 BOLD MRI mapping in iPlan Cranial 3.0 software (Brainlab AG) included task-based functional acquisitions, definition of block design functional task, and creation of 3-dimensional objects from activation areas. 6,7 Analysis and visualization of the fMRI data were performed using Brain Voyager QX (Brain Innovation BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands) software. Slice scan time correction, 3-dimensional motion correction, and correction of linear trend were applied to all functional data using the preprocessing procedures implemented in Brain Voyager QX (Brain Innovation BV) as previously published by the senior author. 11,12 The details are provided elsewhere in literature. 6,7,11,12 Questions have been raised about the validity of statistical methods in fMRI. 13 Any sophisticated modality has several bugs and limitations, which are mostly known and should be controlled. 14,15 Considering all limitations, fMRI has resulted in improved outcomes and reduced postoperative morbidity. 16,17 fMRI is not the only methodology that has clear and serious limitations. Therefore, a multimodal approach is necessary for studying the brain's function and dysfunction, 15 as described in the current study.},

The simplifying assumptions of the model are tested by comparison with the "model-free" q-ball analysis of in vivo data and the results are shown to be in good agreement.

A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique.},

The method is based on registering the individual volumes to a model free prediction of what each volume should look like, thereby enabling its use on high b-value data where the contrast is vastly different in different volumes.

  abstract = {Previous studies to simulate brain tumor progression, often investigate either temporal changes in cancer cell density or the overall tissue-level growth of the tumor mass. Here, we developed a computational model to bridge these two approaches. The model incorporates the tumor biomechanical response at the tissue level and accounts for cellular events by modeling cancer cell proliferation, infiltration to surrounding tissues, and invasion to distant locations. Moreover, acquisition of high resolution human data from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and perfusion imaging was employed within the simulations towards a realistic and patient specific model. The model predicted the intratumoral mechanical stresses to range from 20 to 34 kPa, which caused an up to 4.5 mm displacement to the adjacent healthy tissue. Furthermore, the model predicted plausible cancer cell invasion patterns within the brain along the white matter fiber tracts. Finally, by varying the tumor vascular density and its invasive outer ring thickness, our model showed the potential of these parameters for guiding the timing (83–90 days) of cancer cell distant invasion as well as the number (0–2 sites) and location (temportal and/or parietal lobe) of the invasion sites.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose There is limited standardization of acquisition and processing methods in diffusion tractography for pre-surgical planning, leading to a range of approaches. In this study, a number of representative acquisition variants and post processing methods are considered, to assess their importance when implementing a clinical tractography program. Methods Diffusion MRI was undertaken in ten healthy volunteers, using protocols typical of clinical and research scanning: a 32-direction diffusion acquisition with and without peripheral gating, and a non-gated 64 diffusion direction acquisition. All datasets were post-processed using diffusion tensor reconstruction with streamline tractography, and with constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) with both streamline and probabilistic tractography, to delineate the cortico-spinal tract (CST) and optic radiation (OR). The accuracy of tractography results was assessed against a histological atlas using a novel probabilistic Dice overlap technique, together with direct comparison to tract volumes and distance of Meyer’s loop to temporal pole (ML-TP) from dissections studies. Three clinical case studies of patients with space occupying lesions were also investigated. Results Tracts produced by CSD with probabilistic tractography provided the greatest overlap with the histological atlas (overlap scores of 44\% and 52\% for the CST and OR, respectively) and best matched tract volume and ML-TP distance from dissection studies. The acquisition protocols investigated had limited impact on the accuracy of the tractography. In all patients, the CSD based probabilistic tractography created tracts with greatest anatomical plausibility, although in one case anatomically plausible pathways could not be reconstructed without reducing the probabilistic threshold, leading to an increase in false positive tracts. Conclusions Advanced post processing techniques such as CSD with probabilistic tractography are vital for pre-surgical planning. However, overall accuracy relative to dissection studies remains limited.},

  abstract = {To characterize anisotropic water diffusion in brain white matter, a theoretical framework is proposed that combines hindered and restricted models of water diffusion (CHARMED) and an experimental methodology that embodies features of diffusion tensor and q-space MRI. This model contains a hindered extra-axonal compartment, whose diffusion properties are characterized by an effective diffusion tensor, and an intra-axonal compartment, whose diffusion properties are characterized by a restricted model of diffusion within cylinders. The hindered model primarily explains the Gaussian signal attenuation observed at low b values; the restricted non-Gaussian model does so at high b. Both high and low b data obtained along different directions are required to estimate various microstructural parameters of the composite model, such as the nerve fiber orientation(s), the T2-weighted extra- and intra-axonal volume fractions, and principal diffusivities. The proposed model provides a description of restricted diffusion in 3D given by a 3D probability distribution (average propagator), which is obtained by 3D Fourier transformation of the estimated signal attenuation profile. The new model is tested using synthetic phantoms and validated on excised spinal cord tissue. This framework shows promise in determining the orientations of two or more fiber compartments more precisely and accurately than with diffusion tensor imaging.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the utility of diffusion MRI for extraction of microstructural information of neuronal tissue, specifically the white matter. Neuronal tissues in general, and white matter in particular, are complex tissue structures composed of several cellular compartments. Diffusion MRI has the potential to infer features of these compartments as it actually measures the mean displacement of water molecules rather than their diffusion coefficient. Thus, assuming that the displacement of water molecules is affected by tissue microstructure, diffusion MRI should become sensitive to structural parameters of the tissue. The signal decay in diffusion MRI experiments is complicated and only part of it is acquired and analyzed by conventional diffusion imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). When acquiring the entire signal decay, it is apparent that it is composed of several diffusing components (free, hindered, and restricted diffusion), allowing compartment-specific information to be retrieved, using advanced acquisition and analysis frameworks. The analysis frameworks (e.g. q-space imaging and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED)) follow the q-space theory and relate signal properties to displacement characteristics. It is suggested that restricted diffusion is apparent in neuronal tissues with water molecule diffusion within the axons as the main contributor to it. Thus restricted diffusion as measured by MRI enables the extraction of quantitative, morphologically related parameters such as the axon density and axon diameter distributions. The different analysis routines and their biophysical meaning along with selected applications are presented and discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard = 0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard = 0.669. ±. 0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Increasing evidence supports the model of dorsal and ventral streams of information flow between language-related areas. Therefore, a review of the descriptions of language-related fiber anatomy in the human and monkey brain was performed. In addition, case studies of macroscopical fiber dissection and polarized light imaging (PLI) with special focus on the ventral stream were done. Several fiber structures can be identified to play a role in language, i.e. the arcuate fasciculus as a part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the middle longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and extreme and external capsules. Substantial differences between human and monkey fiber architecture have been identified. Despite inconsistencies based on different terminologies used, there can be no doubt that dorsal and ventral language streams have a clear correlation in the structure of white matter tracts.},

We make use of parameterized curves with Frenet-Serret frame and introduce a highly flexible mechanism for controlling geometric regularity. At the same time, we incorporate a novel local data support term in order to account for topographic organization. Unifying geometry with topographic regularity, we develop a Bayesian framework for generating highly organized streamlines that accurately follow neuroanatomy. We additionally propose two novel validation techniques to quantify topographic regularity. In our experiments, we studied the results of our approach with respect to connectivity, reproducibility and topographic regularity aspects. We present both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of our technique against three algorithms from MRtrix3. We show that our method successfully generates highly organized fiber tracks while capturing bundle anatomy that are geometrically challenging for other approaches.},

Although tracking algorithms have improved during the last two decades, results of validation studies and international challenges warn about the reliability of tractography and point out the need for improved algorithms. In propagation-based tracking, connections have traditionally been modeled as piece-wise linear segments. In this work, we propose a novel propagation-based tracker that is capable of generating geometrically smooth ( \{C\}\^\{\{1\}\} ) curves using parallel transport frames. Notably, our approach does not increase the complexity of the propagation problem that remains two-dimensional. Moreover, our tracker has a novel mechanism to reduce noise related propagation errors by incorporating topographic regularity of connections, a neuroanatomic property of many brain pathways. We ran extensive experiments and compared our approach against deterministic and other probabilistic algorithms. Our experiments on FiberCup and ISMRM 2015 challenge datasets as well as on 56 subjects of the Human Connectome Project show highly promising results both visually and quantitatively. Open-source implementations of the algorithm are shared publicly.},

Here, we integrate the connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping framework with sparse partial least squares regression (sPLS-R) to isolate elements of the connectome associated with speech repetition deficits. By mapping over 2,500 connections of the structural connectome in a cohort of 71 stroke-induced cases of aphasia presenting with varying left-hemisphere lesions and repetition impairment, sPLS-R was trained on 50 subjects to algorithmically identify connectomic features on the basis of their predictive value. The highest ranking features were subsequently used to generate a parsimonious predictive model for speech repetition whose predictions were evaluated on a held-out set of 21 subjects. A set of 10 short- and long-range parieto-temporal connections were identified, collectively delineating the broader circuitry of the dorsal white matter network of the language system. The strongest contributing feature was a short-range connection in the supramarginal gyrus, approximating the cortical localization of area Spt, with parallel long-range pathways interconnecting posterior nodes in supramarginal and superior temporal cortex with anterior nodes in both ventral and—notably—in dorsal premotor cortex, respectively. The collective disruption of these pathways indexed repetition performance in the held-out set of participants, suggesting that these impairments might be characterized as a parietotemporal disconnection syndrome impacting cortical area Spt and its associated white matter circuits of the frontal lobe as opposed to being purely a disconnection of the arcuate fasciculus.},

A key step for successful tractography of neuronal tracts is the correct identification of tract directions in each voxel. Here we propose a fingerprinting-based methodology to identify these fiber directions in Orientation Distribution Functions, dubbed ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP). In ODF-FP, fiber configurations are selected based on the similarity between measured ODFs and elements in a pre-computed library. In noisy ODFs, the library matching algorithm penalizes the more complex fiber configurations. ODF simulations and analysis of bootstrapped partial and whole-brain in vivo datasets show that the ODF-FP approach improves the detection of fiber pairs with small crossing angles while maintaining fiber direction precision, which leads to better tractography results. Rather than focusing on the ODF maxima, the ODF-FP approach uses the whole ODF shape to infer fiber directions to improve the detection of fiber bundles with small crossing angle. The resulting fiber directions aid tractography algorithms in accurately displaying neuronal tracts and calculating brain connectivity.},

The arcuate plays a key role in the language network and is believed to be left-lateralized, in line with left hemisphere dominance for language. Measuring the arcuate in vivo requires diffusion magnetic resonance imaging–based tractography, but asymmetry of the in vivo arcuate is not always reliably detected in previous studies. It is unknown how the choice of tractography algorithm, with each method's freedoms, constraints, and vulnerabilities to false-positive and -negative errors, impacts findings of arcuate asymmetry. Here, we identify the arcuate in two independent datasets using a number of tractography strategies and methodological constraints, and assess their impact on estimates of arcuate laterality. We test three tractography methods: a deterministic, a probabilistic, and a tractography-evaluation (LiFE) algorithm. We extract the arcuate from the whole-brain tractogram, and compare it to an arcuate bundle constrained even further by selecting only those streamlines that connect to anatomically relevant cortical regions. We test arcuate macrostructure laterality, and also evaluate microstructure profiles for properties such as fractional anisotropy and quantitative R1. We find that both tractography choice and implementing the cortical constraints substantially impact estimates of all indices of arcuate laterality. Together, these results emphasize the effect of the tractography pipeline on estimates of arcuate laterality in both macrostructure and microstructure.},

Historical and modern conceptualisations of the tracts' neuroanatomical origins and terminations will be discussed, and key discrepancies and debates examined.

Alterations in neural structure and complexity were inferred from changes in mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, analyzed by sampling regions of interest and also by a unique whole-cortex mapping approach. Mean diffusivity was higher in gyri than sulci and in frontal compared with occipital lobes, decreasing consistently throughout the study period. Fractional anisotropy declined until 38 wk, with initial values and rates of change higher in gyri, frontal and temporal poles, and parietal cortex; and lower in sulcal, perirolandic, and medial occipital cortex. Neuroanatomical studies and experimental diffusion-anatomic correlations strongly suggested the interpretation that cellular and synaptic complexity and density increased steadily throughout the period, whereas elongation and branching of dendrites orthogonal to cortical columns was later and faster in higher-order association cortex, proceeding rapidly before becoming undetectable after 38 wk. The rate of microstructural maturation correlated locally with cortical growth, and predicted higher neurodevelopmental test scores at 2 y of age. Cortical microstructural development was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by longer premature exposure to the extrauterine environment, and preterm infants at term-corrected age possessed less mature cortex than term-born infants. The results are compatible with predictions of the tension theory of cortical growth and show that rapidly developing cortical microstructure is vulnerable to the effects of premature birth, suggesting a mechanism for the adverse effects of preterm delivery on cognitive function.},

  abstract = {The existence of the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFOF) in the human brain remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to clarify the existence, course, and terminations of the SFOF. High angular diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) analysis was performed on six healthy adults and on a template of 842 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. To verify tractography results, we performed fiber microdissections of four post-mortem human brains. Based on DSI tractography, we reconstructed the SFOF in the subjects and the template from the Human Connectome Project that originated from the rostral and medial parts of the superior and middle frontal gyri. By tractography, we found that the fibers formed a compact fascicle at the level of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle coursing above the head of caudate nucleus, medial to the corona radiate and under the corpus callosum (CC), and terminated at the parietal region via the lower part of the caudate nucleus. We consider that this fiber bundle observed by tractography is the SFOF, although it terminates mainly at the parietal region, rather than occipital lobe. By contrast, we were unable to identify a fiber bundle corresponding to the SFOF in our fiber dissection study. Although we did not provide definite evidence of the SFOF in the human brain, these findings may be useful for future studies in this field.},

  abstract = {Three major white matter pathways connect the posterior temporal region and the adjacent inferior parietal lobule with the lateral frontal cortex: the arcuate fasciculus (AF), and the second and third branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF II and SLF III). These pathways are found also in nonhuman primate brains where they play specific roles in auditory and spatial processing. The precise origin, course, and termination of these pathways has been examined in invasive tract tracing studies in macaque monkeys. Here we use this prior knowledge to improve dissections of these pathways in vivo in the human brain using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tractography. In this study, the AF, originating from the posterior temporal cortex, has been successfully separated from the SLF II and SLF III tracts originating from the angular and supramarginal gyri of the inferior parietal lobule, respectively. The latter two pathways, i.e. SLF II and SLF III, have also been clearly separated from each other. Furthermore, we report for the first time in the human brain the dorsal branch of the AF that targets the posterior dorsolateral frontal region. These improved dissection protocols provide a solid basis for exploring the respective functional roles of these major fasciculi.},

  abstract = {Registration of Diffusion Weighted (DW)-MRI datasets has been commonly achieved to date in literature by using either scalar or 2nd-order tensorial information. However, scalar or 2nd-order tensors fail to capture complex local tissue structures, such as fiber crossings, and therefore, datasets containing fiber-crossings cannot be registered accurately by using these techniques. In this paper we present a novel method for non-rigidly registering DW-MRI datasets that are represented by a field of 4th-order tensors. We use the Hellinger distance between the normalized 4th-order tensors represented as distributions, in order to achieve this registration. Hellinger distance is easy to compute, is scale and rotation invariant and hence allows for comparison of the true shape of distributions. Furthermore, we propose a novel 4th-order tensor re-transformation operator, which plays an essential role in the registration procedure and shows significantly better performance compared to the re-orientation operator used in literature for DTI registration. We validate and compare our technique with other existing scalar image and DTI registration methods using simulated diffusion MR data and real HARDI datasets.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not. © 1994, The Biophysical Society.

DTI also furnishes scalar parameters that behave like quantitative histological or physiological 'stains' for different features of diffusion. These include Trace(D), which is related to the mean diffusivity, and a family of parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which characterize different features of anisotropic diffusion.

First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

In this context, we present a novel approach to adapt a healthy brain atlas to MR images of tumor patients. In order to establish correspondence between a healthy atlas and a pathologic patient image, tumor growth modeling in combination with registration algorithms is employed. In a first step, the tumor is grown in the atlas based on a new multiscale, multiphysics model including growth simulation from the cellular level up to the biomechanical level, accounting for cell proliferation and tissue deformations. Large-scale deformations are handled with an Eulerian approach for finite element computations, which can operate directly on the image voxel mesh. Subsequently, dense correspondence between the modified atlas and patient image is established using nonrigid registration. The method offers opportunities in atlas-based segmentation of tumor-bearing brain images as well as for improved patient-specific simulation and prognosis of tumor progression. © 2011 IEEE.},

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview by giving a brief introduction to brain tumors and imaging of brain tumors first. Then, we review the state of the art in segmentation, registration and modeling related to tumor-bearing brain images with a focus on gliomas. The objective in the segmentation is outlining the tumor including its sub-compartments and surrounding tissues, while the main challenge in registration and modeling is the handling of morphological changes caused by the tumor. The qualities of different approaches are discussed with a focus on methods that can be applied on standard clinical imaging protocols. Finally, a critical assessment of the current state is performed and future developments and trends are addressed, giving special attention to recent developments in radiological tumor assessment guidelines. © 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a review of publications concerning different aspects of intraoperative brain shift especially in a tumor resection surgery such as intraoperative imaging systems, quantification, measurement, modeling, and registration techniques. Clinical experience of using intraoperative imaging modalities, details about registration, and modeling methods in connection with brain shift in tumor resection surgery are the focuses of this review. In total, 126 papers regarding this topic are analyzed in a comprehensive summary and are categorized according to fourteen criteria. The result of the categorization is presented in an interactive web tool. The consequences from the categorization and trends in the future are discussed at the end of this work.},

Compensating for this deformation during surgery is essential for effective guidance. In this paper, we propose a method for brain shift compensation based on registration of vessel centerlines derived from preoperative C-Arm cone beam CT (CBCT) images, to intraoperative ones. A hybrid mixture model (HdMM)-based non-rigid registration approach was formulated wherein, Student’s t and Watson distributions were combined to model positions and centerline orientations of cerebral vasculature, respectively. Following registration of the preoperative vessel centerlines to its intraoperative counterparts, B-spline interpolation was used to generate a dense deformation field and warp the preoperative image to each intraoperative image acquired. Registration accuracy was evaluated using both synthetic and clinical data. The former comprised CBCT images, acquired using a deformable anthropomorphic brain phantom. The latter meanwhile, consisted of four 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images of one patient, acquired before, during and after surgical tumor resection. HdMM consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art point matching method, coherent point drift (CPD), resulting in significantly lower registration errors. For clinical data, the registration error was reduced from 3.73 mm using CPD to 1.55 mm using the proposed method.},

We report a novel application of an automated image registration procedure based on skull segmentation for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired before, during and after surgery (i.e., perioperative). The procedure was implemented to assist analysis of intraoperative brain shift in 11 pediatric epilepsy surgery cases, each of whom had up to five consecutive perioperative MRI scans. The procedure consisted of the following steps: (1) Skull segmentation using tissue classification tools. (2) Estimation of rigid body transformation between image pairs using registration driven by the skull segmentation. (3) Composition of transformations to provide transformations between each scan and a common space. The procedure was validated using locations of three types of reference structural landmarks: the skull pin sites, the eye positions, and the scalp skin surface, detected using the peak intensity gradient. The mean target registration error (TRE) scores by skull pin sites and scalp skin rendering were around 1 mm and {$<$} 1 mm, respectively. Validation by eye position demonstrated {$>$}1 mm TRE scores, suggesting it is not a reliable reference landmark in surgical scenarios. Comparable registration accuracy was achieved between opened and closed skull scan pairs and closed and closed skull scan pairs. Our procedure offers a reliable registration framework for processing intrasubject time series perioperative MRI data, with potential of improving intraoperative MRI-based image guidance in neurosurgical practice.

  abstract = {Purpose: To introduce a tool allowing neurosurgeons to evaluate the results of research tractography workflows for presurgical planning and intraoperative image-guidance, using standard neurosurgical navigation platforms. Theory and Methods: Improving communication between neurosurgeons and researchers developing new image acquisition and processing methods is critical for rapid translation of research to surgical practice. Presenting research outputs within existing clinical workflows is one approach that can assist such interdisciplinary communication. Neurosurgical navigation platforms can display and manipulate a wide range of medical image data and associated delineations and thus allow clinicians to evaluate the impact of new imaging research on their work. Currently, it is extremely difficult to integrate research-based image processing outputs into standard neurosurgical navigation platforms. Results: In this note we introduce Karawun, an open-source software tool for converting outputs from research imaging pipelines, especially diffusion MRI tractography reconstructions using advanced methodologies currently unavailable on commercial navigation platforms, into forms that can be imported into the Brainlab neurosurgical navigation platform (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany). The externally created tractography images and delineations can be viewed and manipulated as if they were created by Brainlab. We illustrate how two surgical workups, created using open-source tools and different processing choices can be presented to the neurosurgeon who can evaluate the impact of the differences between the two workups on surgical decisions. Conclusion: Karawun allows researchers developing novel imaging methodologies to display their results in environments that are familiar to clinical end-users, especially neurosurgeons, thus assisting translation of research into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The neuroimaging research community—which includes a broad range of scientific, medical, statistical, and engineering disciplines—has developed many tools to advance our knowledge of brain structure, function, development, aging, and disease. Past research efforts have clearly shaped clinical practice. However, translation of new methodologies into clinical practice is challenging. Anything that can reduce these barriers has the potential to improve the rate at which research outcomes can contribute to clinical practice. In this article, we introduce Karawun, a file format conversion tool, that has become a key part of our work in translating advances in diffusion imaging acquisition and analysis into neurosurgical practice at our institution. Methods: Karawun links analysis workflows created using open-source neuroimaging software, to Brainlab (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany), a commercially available surgical planning and navigation suite. Karawun achieves this using DICOM standards supporting representation of 3D structures, including tractography streamlines, and thus offers far more than traditional screenshot or color overlay approaches. Results: We show that neurosurgical planning data, created from multimodal imaging data using analysis methods implemented in open-source research software, can be imported into Brainlab. The datasets can be manipulated as if they were created by Brainlab, including 3D visualizations of white matter tracts and other objects. Conclusion: Clinicians can explore and interact with the results of research neuroimaging pipelines using familiar tools within their standard clinical workflow, understand the impact of the new methods on their practice and provide feedback to methods developers. This capability has been important to the translation of advanced analysis techniques into practice at our institution.},

The fact that water diffusion is sensitive to the underlying tissue microstructure provides a unique method of assessing the orientation and integrity of these neural fibres, which may be useful in assessing a number of neurological disorders. The purpose of this review is to characterize the relationship of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of water diffusion and its anisotropy (i.e. directional dependence) with the underlying microstructure of neural fibres. The emphasis of the review will be on model neurological systems both in vitro and in vivo. A systematic discussion of the possible sources of anisotropy and their evaluation will be presented followed by an overview of various studies of restricted diffusion and compartmentation as they relate to anisotropy. Pertinent pathological models, developmental studies and theoretical analyses provide further insight into the basis of anisotropic diffusion and its potential utility in the nervous system.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The present work introduces a novel method for approximating mass effect of primary brain tumors. Methods: The spatio-temporal dynamics of cancerous cells are modeled by means of a deterministic reaction-diffusion equation. Diffusion tensor information obtained from a probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging atlas is incorporated into the model to simulate anisotropic diffusion of cancerous cells. To account for the expansive nature of the tumor, the computed net cell density of malignant cells is linked to a parametric deformation model. This mass effect model is based on the so-called directly manipulated free form deformation. Spatial correspondence between two successive simulation steps is established by tracking landmarks, which are attached to the boundary of the gross tumor volume. The movement of these landmarks is used to compute the new configuration of the control points and, hence, determines the resulting deformation. To prevent a deformation of rigid structures (i.e. the skull), fixed shielding landmarks are introduced. In a refinement step, an adaptive landmark scheme ensures a dense sampling of the tumor isosurface, which in turn allows for an appropriate representation of the tumor shape. Results: The influence of different parameters on the model is demonstrated by a set of simulations. Additionally, simulation results are qualitatively compared to an exemplary set of clinical magnetic resonance images of patients diagnosed with high-grade glioma. Conclusions: Careful visual inspection of the results demonstrates the potential of the implemented model and provides first evidence that the computed approximation of tumor mass effect is sensible. The shape of diffusive brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) can be recovered and approximately matches the observations in real clinical data. © 2010 CARS.},

  abstract = {The Arcuate Fasciculus (AF) is of considerable interdisciplinary interest, because of its major implication in language processing. Theories about language brain evolution are based on anatomical differences in the AF across primates. However, changing methodologies and nomenclatures have resulted in conflicting findings regarding interspecies AF differences: Historical knowledge about the AF originated from human blunt dissections and later from monkey tract-tracing studies. Contemporary tractography studies reinvestigate the fasciculus’ morphology, but remain heavily bound to unclear anatomical priors and methodological limitations. First, we aim to disentangle the influences of these three epistemological steps on existing AF conceptions, and to propose a contemporary model to guide future work. Second, considering the influence of various AF conceptions, we discuss four key evolutionary changes that propagated current views about language evolution: 1) frontal terminations, 2) temporal terminations, 3) greater Dorsal- versus Ventral Pathway expansion, 4) lateralisation. We conclude that new data point towards a more shared AF anatomy across primates than previously described. Language evolution theories should incorporate this more continuous AF evolution across primates.},

A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results. This technique is then applied to the estimation of the cortical connectivity of the human thalamus.

Classification of thalamic gray matter based on cortical connectivity patterns revealed distinct subregions whose locations correspond to nuclei described previously in histological studies. The connections that we found between thalamus and cortex were similar to those reported for non-human primates and were reproducible between individuals. Our results provide the first quantitative demonstration of reliable inference of anatomical connectivity between human gray matter structures using diffusion data and the first connectivity-based segmentation of gray matter.},

  abstract = {Imaging and delineation of the optic radiations (OpRs) remains challenging, despite repeated attempts to achieve reliable validated tractography of this complex structure. Previous studies have used varying methods to generate representations of the OpR which differ markedly from one another and, frequently, from the OpR's known structure. We systematically examined the influence of a key variable that has differed across previous studies, the tractography seed region, in 13 adult participants (nine male; mean age 31 years; SD 8.7 years; range 16–47). First, we compared six seed regions at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and sagittal stratum based on the literature and known OpR anatomy. Three of the LGN regions seeded streamlines consistent with the OpR's three “bundles,” whereas a fourth seeded streamlines consistent with each of the three bundles. The remaining two generated OpR streamlines unreliably and inconsistently. Two stratum regions seeded the radiations. This analysis identified a set of optimal regions of interest (ROI) for seeding OpR tractography and important inclusion and exclusion ROI. An optimized approach was then used to seed LGN regions to the stratum. The radiations, including streamlines consistent with Meyer's Loop, were streamlined in all cases. Streamlines extended 0.2 ± 2.4 mm anterior to the tip of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. These data suggest some existing approaches likely seed representations of the OpR that are visually plausible but do not capture all OpR components, and that using an optimized combination of regions seeded previously allows optimal mapping of this complex structure.

Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (such as diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) have been utilized to determine the infiltrative nature and resectability of ISCN. However, this has not been applied to intraoperative decision making. OBJECTIVE: To present a case series of 2 patients with ISCN, the first to combine use of DTI, pre- and intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality imaging, and microscope integrated navigation with heads-up display. METHODS: Two patients who underwent surgery for ISCN were included. DTI images were obtained and 3D images were created using Surgical Theater (Surgical Theater SRP, Version 7.4.0, Cleveland, Ohio). Fiducials were used to achieve accurate surface registration to C4. Navigation confirmed the levels of laminectomy necessary. The microscope was integrated with Brainlab (Brainlab AG Version 3.0.5, Feldkirchen, Germany) and the tumor projected in the heads-up display. Surgical Theater was integrated with Brainlab to allow for real time evaluation of the 3D tractography. RESULTS: Case 1: All tracts were pushed away from the tumor, suggesting it was not infiltrative. Surgical Theater and Brainlab assisted in confirming midline despite the abnormal swelling of the cord so the myelotomy could be performed. The heads-up display outline demonstrated excellent correlation to the tumor. Gross total resection was achieved. Diagnosis of ependymoma was confirmed. Case 2: Some tracts were going through the tumor itself, suggesting an infiltrative process. Surgical Theater and Brainlab again allowed for confirmation of the midline raphe. Near total resection of the enhancing portion was achieved. Diagnosis of glioblastoma was confirmed. CONCLUSION: This is a proof of concept application where multi-modal imaging technology was utilized for safest maximal ISCN resection. Copyright © 2019 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

It is widely assumed that repetition deficits correlate with injury to the left perisylvian core including the arcuate fasciculus (AF). However, descriptions of normal repetition despite damage to the AF or impaired repetition without AF involvement cast doubts on its role in repetition. To explain these paradoxes, we analyse two different aphasic syndromes - in which repetition is selectively impaired (conduction aphasia) or spared (transcortical aphasias) - in light of recent neuroimaging findings. We suggest that the AF and other white matter bundles are the anatomical signatures of language repetition and that individual variability in their anatomy and lateralisation may explain negative cases. © 2011 Elsevier Srl.},

A substantial body of literature is related to methods that automatically segment bundles from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data indirectly, by exploiting either the idea of connectivity between regions or the geometry of fiber paths obtained with tractography techniques, or, directly, through the information in volumetric data. Despite the remarkable improvement in automatic segmentation methods over the years, their segmentation quality is not yet satisfactory, especially when dealing with datasets with very diverse characteristics, such as different tracking methods, bundle sizes or data quality. In this work, we propose a novel, supervised streamline-based segmentation method, called Classifyber, which combines information from atlases, connectivity patterns, and the geometry of fiber paths into a simple linear model. With a wide range of experiments on multiple datasets that span from research to clinical domains, we show that Classifyber substantially improves the quality of segmentation as compared to other state-of-the-art methods and, more importantly, that it is robust across very diverse settings. We provide an implementation of the proposed method as open source code, as well as web service.},

  abstract = {Individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) may have significant language deficits. Language capabilities may further decline following temporal lobe resections. The language network, comprising dispersed gray matter regions interconnected with white matter fibers, may be atypical in individuals with TLE. This review explores the structural changes to the language network and the functional reorganization of language abilities in TLE. We discuss the importance of detailed reporting of patient's characteristics, such as, left- and right-sided focal epilepsies as well as lesional and nonlesional pathological subtypes. These factors can affect the healthy functioning of gray and/or white matter. Dysfunction of white matter and displacement of gray matter function could concurrently impact their ability, in turn, producing an interactive effect on typical language organization and function. Surgical intervention can result in impairment of function if the resection includes parts of this structure-function network that are critical to language. In addition, impairment may occur if language function has been reorganized and is included in a resection. Conversely, resection of an epileptogenic zone may be associated with recovery of cortical function and thus improvement in language function. We explore the abnormality of functional regions in a clinically applicable framework and highlight the differences in the underlying language network. Avoidance of language decline following surgical intervention may depend on tailored resections to avoid critical areas of gray matter and their white matter connections. Further work is required to elucidate the plasticity of the language network in TLE and to identify sub-types of language representation, both of which will be useful in planning surgery to spare language function.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: In medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 30-50\% of patients experience substantial language decline following resection in the language dominant hemisphere. Here, we investigate the contribution of white matter fiber bundle damage to language change at 3- and 12-months after surgery. Methods: We studied 127 patients who underwent TLE surgery from 2010–2019. Neuropsychological testing included picture naming, semantic, and phonemic verbal fluency, performed pre-operatively, 3- and 12-months post-operatively. Outcome was assessed using reliable change index (RCI; clinically significant decline) and change across timepoints (post- minus pre-operative scores). Functional MRI was used to determine language lateralization. The arcuate (AF), inferior fronto-occipital (IFOF), inferior longitudinal, middle longitudinal (MLF), and uncinate fasciculi were mapped using diffusion MRI probabilistic tractography. Resection masks, drawn comparing co-registered pre- and post-operative T1 MRI scans, were used as exclusion regions on pre-operative tractography to estimate the percentage of pre-operative tracts transected in surgery. Chi-squared assessments evaluated the occurrence of RCI-determined language decline. Independent samples T-tests and MM-estimator robust regressions were used to assess the impact of clinical factors and fiber transection on RCI and change outcomes, respectively. Results: Language dominant and non-dominant resections were treated separately for picture naming, as post-operative outcomes were significantly different between these groups. In language dominant hemisphere resections, greater surgical damage to the AF and IFOF was related to RCI-decline at 3 months. Damage to the inferior frontal sub-fasciculus of the IFOF was related to change at 3 months. In language non-dominant hemisphere resections, increased MLF resection was associated with RCI-decline at 3 months, and damage to the anterior sub-fasciculus was related to change at 3 months. Language dominant and non-dominant resections were treated as one cohort for semantic and phonemic fluency, as there were no significant differences in post-operative decline between these groups. Post-operative seizure freedom was associated with an absence of significant language decline 12 months after surgery for semantic fluency. Discussion: We demonstrate a relationship between fiber transection and naming decline after temporal lobe resection. Individualized surgical planning to spare white matter fiber bundles could help to preserve language function after surgery.},

  abstract = {Introduction Lesions in the ventrolateral region of the dominant frontal lobe have been historically associated with aphasia. Recent imaging results suggest that frontal language regions extend beyond classically defined Broca’s area to include the ventral precentral gyrus (VPCG) and the arcuate fasciculus (AF). Frontal gliomas offer a unique opportunity to identify structures that are essential for speech production. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the correlation between language deficits and lesion location in patients with gliomas. Methods Nineteen patients with glioma and 10 healthy subjects were evaluated with diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance (MR) tractography, functional MR (verb generation task) and the Aachener Aphasie Test. Patients were divided into two groups according to lesion location with respect to the ventral precentral sulcus: (i) anterior (n=8) with glioma growing in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and underlying white matter; (ii) posterior (n=11) with glioma growing in the VPCG and underlying white matter. Virtual dissection of the AF, frontal intralobar tract, uncinate fasciculus (UF) and inferior frontal occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was performed with a deterministic approach. Results Seven posterior patients showed aphasia classified as conduction (4), Broca (1), transcortical motor (1) and an isolated deficit of semantic fluency; one anterior patient had transcortical mixed aphasia. All posterior patients had invasion of the VPCG, however only patients with aphasia had also lesion extension to the AF as demonstrated by tractography dissections. All patients with language deficits had high grade glioma. Groups did not differ regarding tumour volume. A functional pars opercularis was identified with functional MR imaging (fMRI) in 17 patients. Conclusions Gliomas growing in the left VPCG are much more likely to cause speech deficits than gliomas infiltrating the IFG, including Broca’s area. Lesion extension to the AF connecting frontal to parietal and temporal regions is an important mechanism for the appearance of aphasia.},

  abstract = {The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in the evaluation of linguistic, interoceptive, and emotional information. A detailed understanding of its subcortical white matter anatomy could improve postoperative morbidity related to surgery in and around this gyrus. Through GQI-based fiber tracking validated by gross anatomical dissection as ground truth, we characterized the fiber tracts of the IFG based on relationships to other well-known neuroanatomic structures. Diffusion imaging from the Human Connectome Project for 10 healthy adult controls was used for fiber tracking analysis. We evaluated the IFG as a whole based on its connectivity with other regions. All tracts were mapped in both hemispheres, and a lateralization index was calculated based on resultant tract volumes. Ten cadaveric dissections were then performed using a modified Klingler technique to demonstrate the location of major tracts. We identified four major connections of the IFG: a white matter bundle corresponding the frontal aslant tract connecting to the superior frontal gyrus; the superior longitudinal fasciculus connecting to the inferior parietal lobule, lateral occipital area, posterior temporal areas, and the temporal pole; the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus connecting to the cuneus and lingual gyrus; and the uncinate fasciculus connecting to the temporal pole. A callosal fiber bundle connecting the inferior frontal gyri bilaterally was also identified. The IFG is an important region implicated in a variety of tasks including language processing, speech production, motor control, interoceptive awareness, and semantic processing.

A detailed understanding of the subcortical white matter tracts connected within the MFG can facilitate improved navigation of white matter lesions in and around this gyrus and explain the postoperative morbidity after surgery. We aimed to characterize the fiber tracts within the MFG according to their connection to neuroanatomic structures through the use of diffusion spectrum imaging-based fiber tractography and validate the findings by gross anatomic dissection for qualitative visual agreement. Methods Tractography analysis was completed using diffusion imaging data from 10 healthy, adult subjects enrolled in the Human Connectome Project. We assessed the MFG as a whole component according to its fiber connectivity with other neural regions. Mapping was completed on all tracts within both hemispheres, with the resultant tract volumes used to calculate a lateralization index. A modified Klingler technique was used on 10 postmortem dissections to demonstrate the location and orientation of the major tracts. Results Two major connections of the MFG were identified: the superior longitudinal fasciculus, which connects the MFG to parts of the inferior parietal lobule, posterior temporal lobe, and lateral occipital cortex; and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, which connected the MFG to the lingual gyrus and cuneus. Intra- and intergyral short association, U-shaped fibers were also identified. Conclusions Subcortical white matter pathways integrated within the MFG include the superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. The MFG is implicated in a variety of tasks involving attention and memory, making it an important cortical region.

  abstract = {The conventional model of language-related brain structure describing the arcuate fasciculus as a key white matter tract providing a direct connection between Wernicke's region and Broca's area has been called into question. Specifically, the inferior precentral gyrus, possessing both primary motor (Brodmann Area [BA] 4) and premotor cortex (BA 6), has been identified as a potential alternative termination. The authors initially localized cortical sites involved in language using measurement of event-related gamma-activity on electrocorticography (ECoG). The authors then determined whether language-related sites of the temporal lobe were connected, via white matter structures, to the inferior frontal gyrus more tightly than to the precentral gyrus. The authors found that language-related sites of the temporal lobe were far more likely to be directly connected to the inferior precentral gyrus through the arcuate fasciculus. Furthermore, tractography was a significant predictor of frontal language-related ECoG findings. Analysis of an interaction between anatomy and tractography in this model revealed tractrography to have the highest predictive value for language-related ECoG findings of the precentral gyrus. This study failed to support the conventional model of language-related brain structure. More feasible models should include the inferior precentral gyrus as a termination of the arcuate fasciculus. The exact functional significance of direct connectivity between temporal language-related sites and the precentral gyrus requires further study. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Diffusion tensor describes the 3D diffusion phenomenon of the protons according to their microenvironmental properties allowing a unique description of the space where this molecular movement takes place. This model provides in vivo demonstration of the complex ultrastructural organization of the white matter as well as structural changes due to tumoral invasion. Current applications of DTI and magnetic resonance tractography allow accurate delineation of the eloquent white matter tracts and their relation with tumoral tissue. This article summarizes the basic physics and clinical applications of DTI in brain tumor diagnosis and follow-up. Effectiveness of different DTI metrics and magnetic resonance tractography is reviewed in tumor characterization, treatment planning and in the assessment of post-therapeutic changes. The limitations and the advancements in DTI era to minimize these limitations are also discussed. Current technical properties of DTI and future expectations of new DTI models make it a very promising tool for more precise evaluation of tumor-related structural changes in white matter tracts. keywords: brain tumors n diffusion n diffusion-tensor imaging n diffusion-tensor metrics n diffusion-weighted MrI n diffusivity n fractional anisotropy n magnetic resonance imaging n MrI n Mr tractography n treatment},

Here, an atlas is defined as the combination of an intensity image (template) and its segmented image (the atlas labels). After registering the atlas template and the target image, the atlas labels are propagated to the target image. We define this process as atlas-based segmentation. In recent years, researchers have investigated registration algorithms to match atlases to query subjects and also strategies for atlas construction. In this paper we present a review of the automated approaches for atlas-based segmentation of magnetic resonance brain images. We aim to point out the strengths and weaknesses of atlas-based methods and suggest new research directions. We use two different criteria to present the methods. First, we refer to the algorithms according to their atlas-based strategy: label propagation, multi-atlas methods, and probabilistic techniques. Subsequently, we classify the methods according to their medical target: the brain and its internal structures, tissue segmentation in healthy subjects, tissue segmentation in fetus, neonates and elderly subjects, and segmentation of damaged brains. A quantitative comparison of the results reported in the literature is also presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract = {Cognitive impairment is a common comorbidity of epilepsy and adversely impacts people with both frontal lobe (FLE) and temporal lobe (TLE) epilepsy. While its neural substrates have been investigated extensively in TLE, functional imaging studies in FLE are scarce. In this study, we profiled the neural processes underlying cognitive impairment in FLE and directly compared FLE and TLE to establish commonalities and differences. We investigated 172 adult participants (56 with FLE, 64 with TLE and 52 controls) using neuropsychological tests and four functional MRI tasks probing expressive language (verbal fluency, verb generation) and working memory (verbal and visuo-spatial). Patient groups were comparable in disease duration and anti-seizure medication load. We devised a multiscale approach to map brain activation and deactivation during cognition and track reorganization in FLE and TLE. Voxel-based analyses were complemented with profiling of task effects across established motifs of functional brain organization: (i) canonical resting-state functional systems; and (ii) the principal functional connectivity gradient, which encodes a continuous transition of regional connectivity profiles, anchoring lower-level sensory and transmodal brain areas at the opposite ends of a spectrum. We show that cognitive impairment in FLE is associated with reduced activation across attentional and executive systems, as well as reduced deactivation of the default mode system, indicative of a large-scale disorganization of task-related recruitment. The imaging signatures of dysfunction in FLE are broadly similar to those in TLE, but some patterns are syndrome-specific: altered default-mode deactivation is more prominent in FLE, while impaired recruitment of posterior language areas during a task with semantic demands is more marked in TLE. Functional abnormalities in FLE and TLE appear overall modulated by disease load. On balance, our study elucidates neural processes underlying language and working memory impairment in FLE, identifies shared and syndrome-specific alterations in the two most common focal epilepsies and sheds light on system behaviour that may be amenable to future remediation strategies.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) streamline tractography is the gold-standard for in vivo estimation of white matter (WM) pathways in the brain. However, the high angular resolution dMRI acquisitions capable of fitting the microstructural models needed for tractography are often time-consuming and not routinely collected clinically, restricting the scope of tractography analyses. To address this limitation, we build on recent advances in deep learning which have demonstrated that streamline propagation can be learned from dMRI directly without traditional model fitting. Specifically, we propose learning the streamline propagator from T1w MRI to facilitate arbitrary tractography analyses when dMRI is unavailable. To do so, we present a novel convolutional-recurrent neural network (CoRNN) trained in a teacher-student framework that leverages T1w MRI, associated anatomical context, and streamline memory from data acquired for the Human Connectome Project. We characterize our approach under two common tractography paradigms, WM bundle analysis and structural connectomics, and find approximately a 5-15\% difference between measures computed from streamlines generated with our approach and those generated using traditional dMRI tractography. When placed in the literature, these results suggest that the accuracy of WM measures computed from T1w MRI with our method is on the level of scan-rescan dMRI variability and raise an important question: is tractography truly a microstructural phenomenon, or has dMRI merely facilitated its discovery and implementation?},

We present an approach to gain spatial resolution using post-processing methods based on diffusion MRI fiber-tracking, to reveal structures beyond the resolution of the acquired imaging voxel; we term such a method as super-resolution track-density imaging (TDI). A major unmet challenge in imaging is the identification of abnormalities in white matter as a cause of illness; super-resolution TDI is shown to produce high-quality white matter images, with high spatial resolution and outstanding anatomical contrast. A unique property of these maps is demonstrated: their spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio can be tailored depending on the chosen image resolution and total number of fiber-tracks generated. Super-resolution TDI should greatly enhance the study of white matter in disorders of the brain and mind. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A biological parameter that would be valuable to be able to extract from diffusion MRI data is the local white matter axonal density. Track-density imaging (TDI) has been used as if it could provide such a measure; however, this has been the subject of controversy, primarily due to the fact that track-count quantitation is highly sensitive to tracking biases and errors. The spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT) post-processing method was recently introduced to minimise tractography biases, and thus provides a more biologically meaningful measure that could be used in track-count mapping (i.e. TDI following SIFT). The TDI intensity following SIFT ideally corresponds to the orientational average of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD), which corresponds to the total Apparent Fibre Density (AFD{$<$}inf{$>$}total{$<$}/inf{$>$}) within the AFD framework; in fact, AFD{$<$}inf{$>$}total{$<$}/inf{$>$} provides a direct measure of local fibre density at native resolution that does not rely on fibre-tracking. In this study, we demonstrate problems associated with quantitative TDI investigations, which can be avoided by using SIFT processing or directly by using AFD{$<$}inf{$>$}total{$<$}/inf{$>$} maps. We also characterise the intra- and inter-subject reproducibility of TDI maps (with and without SIFT pre-processing) and AFD{$<$}inf{$>$}total{$<$}/inf{$>$} maps. It is shown that SIFT improves the quantitative characteristics of TDI, but is still vastly inferior to the properties of the AFD{$<$}inf{$>$}total{$<$}/inf{$>$} parameter itself, because the latter does not require tracking. While standard TDI might be preferable in applications when high anatomical contrast is required, particularly when combined with super-resolution, for voxel-wise quantitation of total tract density (i.e. without tract orientation information) at native resolution, the total AFD maps are preferable to TDI or other related track-count maps. Regardless of the track-count measure, it should be noted that all of these voxel-averaged approaches discard important information that is retained in fibre-specific approaches such as AFD.},

  abstract = {A whole-brain streamlines data-set (so-called tractogram) generated from diffusion MRI provides a wealth of information regarding structural connectivity in the brain. Besides visualisation strategies, a number of post-processing approaches have been proposed to extract more detailed information from the tractogram. One such approach is based on exploiting the information contained in the tractogram to generate track-weighted (TW) images. In the track-weighted imaging (TWI) approach, a very large number of streamlines are often generated throughout the brain, and an image is then computed based on properties of the streamlines themselves (e.g. based on the number of streamlines in each voxel, or their average length), or based on the values of an associated image (e.g. a diffusion anisotropy map, a T2 map) measured at the coordinates of the streamlines. This review article describes various approaches used to generate TW images and discusses the flexible formalism that TWI provides to generate a range of images with very different contrast, as well as the super-resolution properties of the resulting images. It also explains how this approach provides a powerful means to study structural and functional connectivity simultaneously. Finally, a number of key issues for its practical implementation are discussed.},

In this study, we used Diffusion-Weighted (DW) MRI tractography to explore tumor-induced alterations of WM architecture without any a priori knowledge about the fiber paths under consideration. We used deterministic multi-fiber tractography to analyze 16 cases of histolog-ically classified brain tumors (meningioma, low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma) to evaluate the integrity of WM bundles in the tumoral region, in relation to the contralateral unaffected hemisphere. Our new tractographic approach yielded measures of WM involvement which were strongly correlated with the histopathological features of the tumor (r = 0.83, p = 0.0001). In particular, the number of affected fiber tracts were significantly (p = 0.0006) different among tumor types. Our method proposes a new application of diffusion tractography for the detection of tumor aggressiveness in those cases in which the lesion does not involve any major/known WM paths and when a priori information about the local fiber anatomy is lacking.

A newly emerging research framework, developmental connectomics, provides unprecedented opportunities for exploring the developing brain through non-invasive mapping of structural and functional connectivity patterns. Within this framework, we review recent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies investigating connectome development from 20 postmenstrual weeks to 5 years of age. Specifically, we highlight five fundamental principles of brain network development during the critical first years of life, emphasizing strengthened segregation/integration balance, a remarkable hierarchical order from primary to higher-order regions, unparalleled structural and functional maturations, substantial individual variability, and high vulnerability to risk factors and developmental disorders. Following the development of advanced neuroimaging techniques and an emerging developmental connectomic framework, the elaborate and complex reorganization of structural and functional connectomes during the early period of life has been recently explored. Network neuroscience demonstrates the value of a global balance between integration and segregation in developmental connectome models during early development. Explorations in pediatric populations at risk of or with developmental disorders reveal disrupted connectomic properties; these have important potential clinical applications in probing and identifying vulnerability during early development.},

Intraoperative RGB optical imaging is a technique for localizing functional areas of the human cerebral cortex that can be used during neurosurgical procedures. However, it still lacks robustness to be used with neurosurgical microscopes as a clinical standard. In particular, a robust quantification of biomarkers of brain functionality is needed to assist neurosurgeons. We propose a methodology to evaluate and optimize intraoperative identification of brain functional areas by RGB imaging. This consist in a numerical 3D brain model based on Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate intraoperative optical setups for identifying functional brain areas. We also adapted fMRI Statistical Parametric Mapping technique to identify functional brain areas in RGB videos acquired for 12 patients. Simulation and experimental results were consistent and showed that the intraoperative identification of functional brain areas is possible with RGB imaging using deoxygenated hemoglobin contrast. Optical functional identifications were consistent with those provided by EBS and preoperative fMRI. We also demonstrated that a halogen lighting may be particularity adapted for functional optical imaging. We showed that an RGB camera combined with a quantitative modeling of brain hemodynamics biomarkers can evaluate in a robust way the functional areas during neurosurgery and serve as a tool of choice to complement EBS and fMRI.},

This study is aimed at assessing the ability of preoperative DTI tractography in predicting the extent of the resection achievable in surgical removal of gliomas. Patients with low-grade gliomas (LGGs; 46) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs; 27) were studied using a 3T scanner according to a protocol including a morphological study (T2, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery, T1 sequences) and DTI acquisitions (b 1000 s/mm 2, 32 gradient directions). Preoperative tractography was performed off-line on the basis of a streamline algorithm, by reconstructing the inferior fronto-occipital (IFO), the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF), and the corticospinal tract (CST). For each patient, the relationship between each bundle reconstructed and the lesion was analyzed. Initial and residual tumor volumes were measured on preoperative and postoperative 3D fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images for LGGs and postcontrast T1-weighted scans for HGGs. The presence of intact fascicles was predictive of a better surgical outcome, because these cases showed a higher probability of total resection than did subtotal and partial resection. The presence of infiltrated or displaced CST or infiltrated IFO was predictive of a lower probability of total resection, especially for tumors with preoperative volume {$<$}100 cm 3. DTI tractography can thus be considered to be a promising tool for estimating preoperatively the degree of radicality to be reached by surgical resection. This information will aid clinicians in identifying patients who will mostly benefit from surgery. © 2011 The Author(s).},

However, the heterogeneous clinical presentations of conduction aphasia suggest a greater complexity of perisylvian anatomical connections than allowed for in the classical anatomical model. This article re-explores perisylvian language connectivity using in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging data from 11 right-handed healthy male subjects were averaged, and the arcuate fasciculus of the left hemisphere reconstructed from this data using an interactive dissection technique. Beyond the classical arcuate pathway connecting Broca's and Wernicke's areas directly, we show a previously undescribed, indirect pathway passing through inferior parietal cortex. The indirect pathway runs parallel and lateral to the classical arcuate fasciculus and is composed of an anterior segment connecting Broca's territory with the inferior parietal lobe and a posterior segment connecting the inferior parietal lobe to Wernicke's territory. This model of two parallel pathways helps explain the diverse clinical presentations of conduction aphasia. The anatomical findings are also relevant to the evolution of language, provide a framework for Lichtheim's symptom-based neurological model of aphasia, and constrain, anatomically, contemporary connectionist accounts of language.},

  abstract = {Tractography methods based on diffusion tensor imaging can be used to re-explore the anatomical basis of language and its disorders. The coherent function of the language network and its interactions with other neurocognitive networks depend on an orderly set of interconnections. Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging have introduced new methods, based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography, that can reconstruct the trajectories of white matter tracts in the living human brain. The resultant influx of information on human connectional anatomy is likely to reinvigorate models of cognition based on distributed large-scale networks and modernize the disconnection approach to language disorders in neurology and psychiatry. The advent of diffusion tensor imaging has opened a new era in the field and promises to revolutionize the field on two fronts. First, it can be used to reveal structural features unique to humans and by studying large populations one can infer the degree of anatomical heterogeneity from subject to subject. Second, tractography allows one to take a pathway-based approach to disorders of language across the lifespan. Tractography, together with other techniques for exploring brain connectivity, is contributing to shifting the paradigm from localizationism to connectionism once again. This hodological approach to disorders of cognitive function can potentially help resolve dilemmas posed by cases that superficially appear to defy established neurocognitive models. The hodological approach can be applied to any clinico-anatomical correlation study and does not necessarily require the use of DTI tractography.},

  abstract = {The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) is historically described as the longest associative bundle in the human brain and it connects various parts of the occipital cortex, temporo-basal area and the superior parietal lobule to the frontal lobe through the external/extreme capsule complex. The exact functional role and the detailed anatomical definition of the IFOF are still under debate within the scientific community. In this study we present a fiber tracking dissection of the right and left IFOF by using a q-ball residual-bootstrap reconstruction of High-Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) data sets in 20 healthy subjects. By defining a single seed region of interest on the coronal fractional anisotropy (FA) color map of each subject, we investigated all the pathways connecting the parietal, occipital and posterior temporal cortices to the frontal lobe through the external/extreme capsule. In line with recent post-mortem dissection studies we found more extended anterior-posterior association connections than the “classical” fronto-occipital representation of the IFOF. In particular the pathways we evidenced showed: a) diffuse projections in the frontal lobe, b) fronto-parietal lobes connections trough the external capsule in almost all the subjects and c) widespread connections in the posterior regions. Our study represents the first consistent in vivo demonstration across a large group of individuals of these novel anterior and posterior terminations of the IFOF detailed described only by post-mortem anatomical dissection. Furthermore our work establishes the feasibility of consistent in vivo mapping of this architecture with independent in vivo methodologies. In conclusion q-ball tractography dissection supports a more complex definition of IFOF, which includes several subcomponents likely underlying specific function.},

  abstract = {Pre-operative magnetic resonance (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) image volumes are often used for planning and guidance during functional neurosurgical procedures. These operations can include the creation of lesions in the thalamus (thalamotomy) or the globus pallidus (pallidotomy), or the insertion of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the subcortical nuclei. These subcortical targets are often difficult to localize in pre-operative imaging data due to the limited resolution and contrast available in standard MRI or CT techniques. To address this problem, digital atlases of subcortical nuclei are often used to accurately identify surgical targets since they can be warped to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Targeting accuracy thus depends on the quality of the atlas-to-patient warp. In this paper, three atlas-to-patient warping techniques are compared. Two methods rely on an MRI template as an intermediary to estimate a nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation. The third is novel, and uses a pseudo-MRI derived from an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to estimate the nonlinear atlas-to-patient transformation directly. The methods are compared using (1) manual segmentations of subcortical nuclei and (2) functional data from intra-operative thalamic stimulation. The results demonstrate that the template-based atlas-to-patient warping technique is the best of the three for customizing the atlas onto patient data.}

  abstract = {Streamline tractography algorithms infer connectivity from diffusion MRI (dMRI) by following diffusion directions which are similarly aligned between neighboring voxels. However, not all white matter (WM) fascicles are organized in this manner. For example, Meyer’s loop is a highly curved portion of the optic radiation (OR) that exhibits a narrow turn, kissing and crossing pathways, and changes in fascicle dispersion. From a neurosurgical perspective, damage to Meyer’s loop carries a potential risk of inducing vision deficits to the patient, especially during temporal lobe resection surgery. To prevent such impairment, achieving an accurate delineation of Meyer’s loop with tractography is thus of utmost importance. However, current algorithms tend to under-estimate the full extent of Meyer’s loop, mainly attributed to the aforementioned rule for connectivity which requires a direction to be chosen across a field of orientations. In this article, it was demonstrated that MAGNEtic Tractography (MAGNET) can benefit Meyer’s loop delineation by incorporating anatomical knowledge of the expected fiber orientation to overcome local ambiguities. A new ROI-mechanism was proposed which supplies additional information to streamline reconstruction algorithms by the means of oriented priors. Their results showed that MAGNET can accurately generate Meyer’s loop in all of our 15 child subjects (8 males; mean age 10.2 years ± 3.1). It effectively improved streamline coverage when compared with deterministic tractography, and significantly reduced the distance between the anterior-most portion of Meyer’s loop and the temporal pole by 16.7 mm on average, a crucial landmark used for preoperative planning of temporal lobe surgery.

  abstract = {Introduction: Surgical resection is an effective treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy but can result in visual field defects. This could be minimized if surgeons knew the exact location of the anterior part of the optic radiation (OR), the Meyer's loop. To this end, there is increasing prevalence of image-guided surgery using diffusion MRI tractography. Despite considerable effort in developing analysis methods, a wide discrepancy in Meyer's loop reconstructions is observed in the literature. Moreover, the impact of differences in image acquisition on Meyer's loop tractography remains unclear. Here, while employing the same state-of-the-art analysis protocol, we explored the extent to which variance in data acquisition leads to variance in OR reconstruction. Methods: Diffusion MRI data were acquired for the same thirteen healthy subjects using standard and state-of-the-art protocols on three scanners with different maximum gradient amplitudes (MGA): Siemens Connectom (MGA = 300 mT/m); Siemens Prisma (MGA = 80 mT/m) and GE Excite-HD (MGA = 40 mT/m). Meyer's loop was reconstructed on all subjects and its distance to the temporal pole (ML-TP) was compared across protocols. Results: A significant effect of data acquisition on the ML-TP distance was observed between protocols (p {$<$}.01 to 0.0001). The biggest inter-acquisition discrepancy for the same subject across different protocols was 16.5 mm (mean: 9.4 mm, range: 3.7–16.5 mm). Conclusion: We showed that variance in data acquisition leads to substantive variance in OR tractography. This has direct implications for neurosurgical planning, where part of the OR is at risk due to an under-estimation of its location using conventional acquisition protocols.},

  abstract = {Most diffusion magnetic resonance imaging studies of disease rely on statistical comparisons between large groups of patients and healthy participants to infer altered tissue states in the brain; however, clinical heterogeneity can greatly challenge their discriminative power. There is currently an unmet need to move away from the current approach of group-wise comparisons to methods with the sensitivity to detect altered tissue states at the individual level. This would ultimately enable the early detection and interpretation of microstructural abnormalities in individual patients, an important step towards personalized medicine in translational imaging. To this end, Detect was developed to advance diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractometry towards single-patient analysis. By operating on the manifold of white-matter pathways and learning normative microstructural features, our framework captures idiosyncrasies in patterns along white-matter pathways. Our approach paves the way from traditional group-based comparisons to true personalized radiology, taking microstructural imaging from the bench to the bedside. The authors propose Detect, a browser-based anomaly detection framework for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractometry data. The tool leverages normative microstructural brain features derived from healthy participants using deep autoencoders to detect anomalies at the individual level.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear registration plays a central role in most neuroimage analysis methods and pipelines, such as in tractography-based individual and group-level analysis methods. However, nonlinear registration is a non-trivial task, especially when dealing with tractography data that digitally represent the underlying anatomy of the brain’s white matter. Furthermore, such process often changes the structure of the data, causing artifacts that can suppress the underlying anatomical and structural details. In this paper, we introduce BundleWarp, a novel and robust streamline-based nonlinear registration method for the registration of white matter tracts. BundleWarp intelligently warps two bundles while preserving the bundles’ crucial topological features. BundleWarp has two main steps. The first step involves the solution of an assignment problem that matches corresponding streamlines from the two bundles (iterLAP step). The second step introduces streamline-specific point-based deformations while keeping the topology of the bundle intact (mlCPD step). We provide comparisons against streamline-based linear registration and image-based nonlinear registration methods. BundleWarp quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both, and we show that Bundle-Warp can deform and, at the same time, preserve important characteristics of the original anatomical shape of the bundles. Results are shown on 1,728 pairs of bundle registrations across 27 different bundle types. In addition, we present an application of BundleWarp for quantifying bundle shape differences using the generated deformation fields.},

  abstract = {To perform group studies using functional imaging data, the individual brain images are usually transformed into a common coordinate space. The two most widely used spaces in the neuroscience community are the Talairach space and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The Talairach coordinate system has become the standard reference for reporting the brain locations in scientific publication, even when the data have been spatially transformed into different brain templates (e.g., MNI space). When expressed in terms of individual subjects, the mapping of a coordinate in MNI space to the Talairach space generates distinct coordinates for different subjects. In this paper, we describe two approaches to derive the Talairach coordinates from the MNI space, which is based on the ICBM152 template from the International Consortium of Brain Mapping. One approach is the Talairach Method of Piecewise Linear Scaling (TMPLS) as implemented in the AFNI software package; and the other is a template-matching approach using the linear transformation in SPM99. The uncertainty measurements of the mapping results are presented. This may allow researchers to better interpret results reporting in the Talairach coordinates obtained from the MNI space. This study also examines the discrepancy between the derived Talairach coordinates and those obtained from the mni2tal script, a tool commonly used by the neuroimaging community. Large discrepancies are found in the inferior regions, superior frontal and occipital regions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

First, we design a lightweight registration network with an adaptive growth strategy to learn deformation field from multi-level wavelet sub-bands, which facilitates both global and local optimization and achieves registration with high performance. Second, our AMNet is designed for image-wise registration, which adapts the local importance of a region in accordance with the complexity degrees of its deformation, and thereafter improves the registration efficiency and maintains the continuity of the deformation field. Experimental results from five publicly-available brain MR datasets and a synthetic brain MR dataset show that our method achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art medical image registration approaches.},

Methods: Ten patients with brain tumors in the vicinity of motor cortex and evidence of significant peritumoral edema were retrospectively selected for the study. All patients underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including functional MRI (fMRI) and a diffusion-weighted data set with 31 directions. Fiber tracking was performed using both single-tensor streamline and two-tensor UKF tractography methods. A two-region-of-interest approach was used to delineate the CST. Results from the two tractography methods were compared visually and quantitatively. fMRI was applied to identify the functional fiber tracts. Results: Single-tensor streamline tractography underestimated the extent of tracts running through the edematous areas and could only track the medial projections of the CST. In contrast, two-tensor UKF tractography tracked fanning projections of the CST despite peritumoral edema and crossing fibers. Based on visual inspection, the two-tensor UKF tractography delineated tracts that were closer to motor fMRI activations, and it was apparently more sensitive than single-tensor streamline tractography to define the tracts directed to the motor sites. The volume of the CST was significantly larger on two-tensor UKF than on single-tensor streamline tractography (p{$<$} 0.001).

  abstract = {Background It has been established that the diffusion gradient directions in diffusion MRI should be uniformly distributed in 3D spherical space, so that orientation-dependent diffusion properties (e.g., fractional anisotropy or FA) can be properly quantified. Sometimes the acquired data need to be down-sampled along the angular dimension before computing diffusion properties (e.g., to exclude data points corrupted by motion artifact; to harmonize data obtained with different protocols). It is important to quantitatively assess the impact of data down-sampling on measurement of diffusion properties. Materials and methods Here we report 1) a numerical procedure for down-sampling diffusion MRI (e.g., for data harmonization), and 2) a spatial uniformity index of diffusion directions, aiming to predict the quality of the chosen down-sampling schemes (e.g., from data harmonization; or rejection of motion corrupted data points). We quantitatively evaluated human diffusion MRI data, which were down-sampled from 64 or 60 diffusion gradient directions to 30 directions, in terms of their 1) FA value accuracy (using fully-sampled data as the ground truth), 2) FA fitting residuals, and 3) spatial uniformity indices. Results Our experimental data show that the proposed spatial uniformity index is correlated with errors in FA obtained from down-sampled diffusion MRI data. The FA fitting residuals that are typically used to assess diffusion MRI quality are not correlated with either FA errors or spatial uniformity index. Conclusions These results suggest that the spatial uniformity index could be more valuable in assessing quality of down-sampled diffusion MRI data, as compared with FA fitting residual measures. We expect that our implemented software procedure should prove valuable for 1) guiding data harmonization for multi-site diffusion MRI studies, and 2) assessing the impact of rejecting motion corrupted data points on the accuracy of diffusion measures.},

  abstract = {White matter fiber clustering is an important strategy for white matter parcellation, which enables quantitative analysis of brain connections in health and disease. In combination with expert neuroanatomical labeling, data-driven white matter fiber clustering is a powerful tool for creating atlases that can model white matter anatomy across individuals. While widely used fiber clustering approaches have shown good performance using classical unsupervised machine learning techniques, recent advances in deep learning reveal a promising direction toward fast and effective fiber clustering. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework for white matter fiber clustering, Deep Fiber Clustering (DFC), which solves the unsupervised clustering problem as a self-supervised learning task with a domain-specific pretext task to predict pairwise fiber distances. This process learns a high-dimensional embedding feature representation for each fiber, regardless of the order of fiber points reconstructed during tractography. We design a novel network architecture that represents input fibers as point clouds and allows the incorporation of additional sources of input information from gray matter parcellation. Thus, DFC makes use of combined information about white matter fiber geometry and gray matter anatomy to improve the anatomical coherence of fiber clusters. In addition, DFC conducts outlier removal naturally by rejecting fibers with low cluster assignment probability. We evaluate DFC on three independently acquired cohorts, including data from 220 individuals across genders, ages (young and elderly adults), and different health conditions (healthy control and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders). We compare DFC to several state-of-the-art white matter fiber clustering algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DFC in terms of cluster compactness, generalization ability, anatomical coherence, and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {With the advances in diffusion MRI and tractography, numerous atlases of the human pyramidal tract (PyT) have been proposed, but the inherent limitation of tractography to resolve crossing bundles within the centrum semiovale has so far prevented the complete description of the most lateral PyT projections. Here, we combined a precise manual positioning of individual subcortical regions of interest along the descending pathway of the PyT with a new bundle-specific tractography algorithm. This later is based on anatomical priors to improve streamlines tracking in crossing areas. We then extracted both left and right PyT in a large cohort of 410 healthy participants and built a population-based atlas of the whole-fanning PyT with a complete description of its most corticolateral projections. Clinical applications are envisaged, the whole-fanning PyT atlas being likely a better marker of corticospinal integrity metrics than those currently used within the frame of prediction of poststroke motor recovery. The present population-based PyT, freely available, provides an interesting tool for clinical applications to locate specific PyT damage and its impact to the short- and long-term motor recovery after stroke.},

Water diffusivity profiles are modeled as probability density functions on the unit sphere, and the sKL-divergence is computed from a spherical harmonic series, which greatly reduces computational complexity. Adjustment of the orientation of diffusivity functions is essential when the image is being warped, so we propose a fast algorithm to determine the principal direction of diffusivity functions using principal component analysis (PCA). We compare sKL-divergence with other inner-product based cost functions using synthetic samples and real HARDI data, and show that the sKL-divergence is highly sensitive in detecting small differences between two diffusivity profiles and therefore shows promise for applications in the nonlinear registration and multisubject statistical analysis of HARDI data. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to propose methods for assessing the reproducibility of diffusion tractography algorithms in future clinical studies and to show their application to the tractography algorithm developed in our unit, fast marching tractography (FMT). FMT estimates anatomical connectivity between brain regions using the information provided by diffusion tensor imaging. Three major white-matter pathways were investigated in 11 normal subjects - anterior callosal fibers, optic radiations, and pyramidal tracts. FMT was used to generate maps of connectivity metric, and regions of voxels with highest connectivity metric to an anatomically defined starting point were identified for each tract under investigation. The reproducibilities of tract-"normalized" volume (NV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements were assessed over such regions. The values of tract volumes are consistent with the postmortem data. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for FA and NV ranged from 1.7 to 7.1\% and from 2.2 to 18.6\%, respectively. CVs were lowest in the anterior callosal fibers (range: 1.7- 7.8\%), followed by the optic radiations (range: 1.2-18.6\%) and pyramidal tracts (range: 2.6-15.5\%), suggesting that fiber organization plays a role in determining the level of FMT reproducibility. In conclusion, these findings underline the importance of assessing the reliability of diffusion tractography before investigating white matter pathology. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

  abstract = {The goal of probabilistic tractography is to obtain a connectivity index along a white matter pathway that reflects fibre organization and is sensitive to pathological abnormalities contributing to disability. Here, we present the development of voxel-based connectivity measures along the tractography-derived corticospinal tract (CST). We investigated whether these connectivity measures are different in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and correlate with the rate of disease progression. We also investigated whether fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects directional coherence of fibre tracts, is reduced in the CST of ALS patients and relates to disease progression rate. Thirteen patients with probable or definite ALS and 19 healthy subjects were studied. The probabilistic tractography algorithm segmented the bilateral CST, along which FA and connectivity values were obtained. To take into account the asymmetric distribution of connectivity values, two summary statistic measures that focused on voxels with higher connectivity values were selected and then used in the analysis, together with the mean connectivity and the mean FA. To complete the analysis, the same summary measures for FA were included. Differences in all these indices between patients with moderate or rapid disease progression rate and controls were investigated using linear regression, adjusted for age and white matter fraction. The association between FA or connectivity in the CST and the disease progression rate was assessed using linear regression. Patients with a rapid disease progression rate had significantly lower summary connectivity measures than controls in the left CST, but there was only a borderline statistical difference in mean connectivity. Patients with rapid progression had a significantly lower mean FA, and any other FA measure, in both CSTs than controls. When only patients were considered, strong associations between the rate of disease progression and all the connectivity measures in the left CST were found (P-values between P {$<$} 0.001 and P = 0.002, partial correlation coefficients between -0.90 and -0.82). However, there was no evidence of an association between disease progression rate and any of the FA measures in the bilateral CST. Our findings suggest that FA and connectivity provide complementary information, since FA is sensitive to the detection of all the group differences, whereas the summary connectivity measures correlate with disease progression rate. The development of such connectivity measures raises their potential as markers of disease progression in ALS, and provides guidance for their use in other neurological diseases. © The Author (2006).

The GBM speed of growth depends on the invaded tissue: faster in white than in gray matter, it is stopped by the dura or the ventricles. These different structures are introduced into the model using an atlas matching technique. The atlas includes both the segmentations of anatomical structures and diffusion information in white matter fibers. We use the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction with the invaded structures (mass effect). Depending on the considered tissue, the former effect is modeled with a reaction-diffusion or a Gompertz equation, while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new coupling equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. The tumor growth simulation is assessed by comparing the in-silico GBM growth with the real growth observed on two magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a patient acquired with 6 mo difference. Results show the feasibility of this new conceptual approach and justifies its further evaluation. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems allow neurosurgeons to acquire images of the brain during the course of neurosurgical procedures. During surgery, these systems help following the deformation of the brain. However, even if they provide significantly more information than any other intraoperative imaging system, it is not possible to acquire full diffusion tensor, functional MR or high resolution MR images (MRI) in a reasonable time compatible with the procedure. The intraoperative image can be used to measure the brain deformation during surgery. Applying this deformation to the advanced imaging modalities acquired preoperatively makes them virtually available during surgery. This chapter describes a new algorithm to register 3D preoperative MRI to intraoperative MRI of the brain which has undergone brain shift.

As methods for in vivo tractography have been developed, it has become possible to track and segment specific white matter structures of interest for particular study. However, the consistency and reproducibility of tractography-based segmentation remain limited, and attempts to improve them have thus far typically involved the imposition of strong constraints on the tract reconstruction process itself. In this work we take a different approach, developing a formal probabilistic model for the relationships between comparable tracts in different scans, and then using it to choose a tract, a posteriori, which best matches a predefined reference tract for the structure of interest. We demonstrate that this method is able to significantly improve segmentation consistency without directly constraining the tractography algorithm. © 2007 IEEE.},

In common with previously reported neighbourhood tractography (NT) work, the technique optimises seed point placement for fibre tracking by matching the tracts generated using a number of candidate points against a reference tract, which is derived from a white matter atlas in the present study. No direct constraints are applied to the fibre tracking results. An Expectation-Maximisation algorithm is used to fully automate the procedure, and make dramatically more efficient use of data than earlier NT methods. Within-subject and between-subject variances for fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity within the tracts are then separated using a random effects model. We find test-retest coefficients of variation (CVs) similar to those reported in another study using landmark-guided single seed points; and subject to subject CVs similar to a constraint-based multiple ROI method. We conclude that our approach is at least as effective as other methods for tract segmentation using tractography, whilst also having some additional benefits, such as its provision of a goodness-of-match measure for each segmentation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To elucidate the nature and number of dorsal pathways in the human brain, the current study utilized in vivo probabilistic tractography to map the structural connectivity associated with subdivisions of the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). The left SMG is a prominent region within the dorsal stream, which has recently been parcellated into five structurally-distinct regions which possess a dorsal-ventral (and rostral-caudal) organisation, postulated to reflect areas of functional specialisation. The connectivity patterns reveal a dissociation of the arcuate fasciculus into at least two segregated pathways connecting frontal-parietal-temporal regions. Specifically, the connectivity of the inferior SMG, implicated as an acoustic-motor speech interface, is carried by an inner/ventro-dorsal arc of fibres, whilst the pathways of the posterior superior SMG, implicated in object use and cognitive control, forms a parallel outer/dorso-dorsal crescent. © 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {In the treatment of brain tumors, surgical intervention remains a common and effective therapeutic option. Recent advances in neuroimaging have provided neurosurgeons with new tools to overcome the challenge of differentiating healthy tissue from tumor-infiltrated tissue, with the aim of increasing the likelihood of maximizing the extent of resection volume while minimizing injury to functionally important regions. Novel applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and DTI-derived tractography (DDT) have demonstrated that preoperative, non-invasive mapping of eloquent cortical regions and functionally relevant white matter tracts (WMT) is critical during surgical planning to reduce postoperative deficits, which can decrease quality of life and overall survival. In this review, we summarize the latest developments of applying DTI and tractography in the context of resective surgery and highlight its utility within each stage of the neurosurgical workflow: preoperative planning and intraoperative management to improve postoperative outcomes.},

One can now evaluate the results of more than 57,000 fiber tracking outputs using different acquisition settings (b-value, averaging), different local estimation techniques (tensor, q-ball, spherical deconvolution) and different tracking parameters (masking, seeding, maximum curvature, step size). At this stage, the system is solely based on a revised FiberCup analysis, but we hope that the community will get involved and provide us with new phantoms, new algorithms, third party libraries and new geometrical metrics, to name a few.

Overall, we show that (i) averaging improves quality of tractography, (ii) sharp angular ODF profiles helps tractography, (iii) seeding and multi-seeding has a large impact on tractography outputs and must be used with care, and (iv) deterministic tractography produces less invalid tracts which leads to better connectivity results than probabilistic tractography. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Using advanced high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) crossing fiber modeling and tractography robust to partial volume effects, we automatically dissected 50 white matter (WM) fascicles. These fascicles connect deep nuclei (thalamus, putamen, pallidum) to different cortical functional areas (associative, motor, sensorimotor, limbic), basal forebrain and substantia nigra. Then, among these 50 candidate WM fascicles, only the ones that passed a test-retest reproducibility procedure qualified for further tractometry analysis. Leveraging the unique 2-timepoints test-retest Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset of over 600 subjects, we found statistically significant differences in tract profiles along the subcortico-cortical pathways between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. In particular, significant increases in FA, apparent fiber density, tract-density and generalized FA were detected in some locations of the nigro-subthalamo-putaminal-thalamo-cortical pathway. This connection is one of the major motor circuits balancing the coordination of motor output. Detailed and quantifiable knowledge on WM fascicles in these areas is thus essential to improve the quality and outcome of Deep Brain Stimulation, and to target new WM locations for investigation.},

Then, the seeding of a synthetic tumor into the brain atlas provides a template for the lesion. The last step is the deformation of the seeded atlas, combining a method derived from optical flow principles and a model of lesion growth. Results show that a good registration is performed and that the method can be applied to automatic segmentation of structures and substructures in brains with gross deformation, with important medical applications in neurosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiotherapy.},

This study reports the evaluation of optic radiation mapping in protecting against VFDs in the ATLR. We retrospectively analyzed 52 patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing ATLR between January 2012 and December 2013. The surgical operations in Group I (n=32) were performed with the modified ATLR, and the operations in Group II (n=20) were aided by combining optic radiation mapping by diffusion tensor imaging, microscopic-based neuronavigation and the intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) technique. A t-test was used to compare the size of ATLR, and a chi square test was applied for the postoperative VFD and seizure outcomes. The optic radiation was reconstructed in all patients in Group II. The size of ATLR was 5.11±1.34 cm (3.3-8 cm), and 3.24±0.75 cm (2.2-4.8 cm) in Groups I and II, respectively; the size of ATLR was significantly smaller in Group II (F=9.803; P=0.00). The visual fields assessment by the Humphrey Field Analyser 30-2 test showed 27 patients (84.4\%) in Group I suffered VFDs at 3 months post-operation, whereas only eight patients (40.0\%) in Group II showed VFDs (Pearson chi square =11.01; P=0.001). The 6-month follow-up survey showed that 90.6\% of patients in Group I achieved a good outcome (Engel class I-II), outperforming 85.0\% in Group II, however, there was no statistically significant difference (chi square =0.382, P=0.581). This techniques of combining optic radiation mapping, microscopic-based neuronavigation and iMRI aided in precise mapping and hence reduction of the risk of visual field deficits in ATLR. The size of ATLR guided by optic radiation mapping was significantly smaller but the seizure outcome was not significantly affected.},

  abstract = {The surgical management of brain tumors is based on the principle that the extent of resection improves patient outcomes. Traditionally, neurosurgeons have considered that lesions in “non-eloquent” cerebrum can be more aggressively surgically managed compared to lesions in “eloquent” regions with more known functional relevance. Furthermore, advancements in multimodal imaging technologies have improved our ability to extend the rate of resection while minimizing the risk of inducing new neurologic deficits, together referred to as the “onco-functional balance.” However, despite the common utilization of invasive techniques such as cortical mapping to identify eloquent tissue responsible for language and motor functions, glioma patients continue to present post-operatively with poor cognitive morbidity in higher-order functions. Such observations are likely related to the difficulty in interpreting the highly-dimensional information these technologies present to us regarding cognition in addition to our classically poor understanding of the functional and structural neuroanatomy underlying complex higher-order cognitive functions. Furthermore, reduction of the brain into isolated cortical regions without consideration of the complex, interacting brain networks which these regions function within to subserve higher-order cognition inherently prevents our successful navigation of true eloquent and non-eloquent cerebrum. Fortunately, recent large-scale movements in the neuroscience community, such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), have provided updated neural data detailing the many intricate macroscopic connections between cortical regions which integrate and process the information underlying complex human behavior within a brain “connectome.” Connectomic data can provide us better maps on how to understand convoluted cortical and subcortical relationships between tumor and human cerebrum such that neurosurgeons can begin to make more informed decisions during surgery to maximize the onco-functional balance. However, connectome-based neurosurgery and related applications for neurorehabilitation are relatively nascent and require further work moving forward to optimize our ability to add highly valuable connectomic data to our surgical armamentarium. In this manuscript, we review four concepts with detailed examples which will help us better understand post-operative cognitive outcomes and provide a guide for how to utilize connectomics to reduce cognitive morbidity following cerebral surgery.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a time-efficient pulse sequence that acquires multiple diffusion-weighted images with distinct diffusion times in a single shot by using multiple stimulated echoes (mSTE) with variable flip angles (VFA). METHODS: The proposed diffusion-weighted mSTE with VFA (DW-mSTE-VFA) sequence begins with two 90° RF pulses that straddle a diffusion gradient lobe (GD ) to excite and restore one half of the magnetization into the longitudinal axis. The restored longitudinal magnetization was successively re-excited by a series of RF pulses with VFA, each followed by another GD , to generate a set of stimulated echoes. Each of the multiple stimulated echoes was acquired with an EPI echo train. As such, the train of multiple stimulated echoes produced a set of diffusion-weighted images with varying diffusion times in a single shot. This technique was experimentally demonstrated on a diffusion phantom, a fruit, and healthy human brain and prostate at 3\,T. RESULTS: In the phantom experiment, the mean ADC measured at different diffusion times using DW-mSTE-VFA were highly consistent (r\,=\,0.999) with those from a commercial spin-echo diffusion-weighted EPI sequence. In the fruit and brain experiments, DW-mSTE-VFA exhibited similar diffusion-time dependence to a standard diffusion-weighted stimulated echo sequence. The ADC showed significant time dependence in the human brain (p\,=\,0.003 in both white matter and gray matter) and prostate tissues (p\,=\,0.003 in both peripheral zone and central gland). CONCLUSION: DW-mSTE-VFA offers a time-efficient tool for investigating the diffusion-time dependency in diffusion MRI studies.},

Peaks in the diffusion profile were estimated with the single tensor (ST), Q-ball (QSH) and persistent angular structure (PAS) methods. Segmentation of the OR was performed by two experimenters with probabilistic tractography based on a manually drawn region-of-interest (ROI) protocol typically employed for OR segmentation, with both standard and extended sets of ROIs. The repeatability and reproducibility were assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of intra- and inter-rater experiments, respectively. ICCs were calculated for commonly used dMRI metrics (FA, MD, AD, RD) and anatomical dimensions of the optic radiation (distance from Meyer's loop to the temporal pole, ML-TP), as well as the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the raters' OR segmentation. Bland-Altman plots were also calculated to investigate bias and variability in the reproducibility measurements. The OR was successfully reconstructed in all subjects by both raters. The ICC was found to be in the good to excellent range for both repeatability and reproducibility of the dMRI metrics, DSC and ML-TP distance. The Bland-Altman plots did not show any apparent systematic bias for any quantities. Overall, higher ICC values were found for the multi-fiber methods, QSH and PAS, and for the standard set of ROIs. Considering the good to excellent repeatability and reproducibility of all the quantities investigated, these findings support the use of multi-fiber OR reconstruction with a limited number of manually drawn ROIs in clinical applications utilizing either OR microstructure characterization or OR dimensions, as is the case in neurosurgical planning for temporal lobectomy.},

Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is a popular method for comparing diffusion characteristics across subjects. TBSS establishes spatial correspondence using a combination of nonlinear registration and a “skeleton projection” that may break topological consistency of the transformed brain images. We therefore investigated feasibility of replacing the two-stage registration-projection procedure in TBSS with a single, regularized, high-dimensional registration. To optimize registration parameters and to evaluate registration performance in diffusion MRI, we designed an evaluation framework that uses native space probabilistic tractography for 23 white matter tracts, and quantifies tract similarity across subjects in standard space. We optimized parameters for two registration algorithms on two diffusion datasets of different quality. We investigated reproducibility of the evaluation framework, and of the optimized registration algorithms. Next, we compared registration performance of the regularized registration methods and TBSS. Finally, feasibility and effect of incorporating the improved registration in TBSS were evaluated in an example study. The evaluation framework was highly reproducible for both algorithms (R2 0.993; 0.931). The optimal registration parameters depended on the quality of the dataset in a graded and predictable manner. At optimal parameters, both algorithms outperformed the registration of TBSS, showing feasibility of adopting such approaches in TBSS. This was further confirmed in the example experiment.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Quantification of water diffusion anisotropy is one of the key measures that is collected in almost every clinical and neuroscience applications using MR diffusion imaging. In tissues with a high structural organization, such as white matter, the measure of anisotropy provides useful information about microstructural changes that can occur in normal development or in neurological and psychiatric disorders [1]. Today, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) remains the most widely used anisotropy index. Other methods like Generalized Fractional Anisotropy (GFA)[2] and similar indices have been applied as an alternative to FA and to overcome some of the limitations of the diffusion tensor model. However, most of these methods remain strongly model based (the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) profile used to compute the GFA index can change according to the imaging method chosen) or particularly sensitive to noise (the measure of variance across multiple directions is de facto also a way to quantify noise along different directions). The use of spherical harmonics (SH) of even order l ≥ 2 to characterize anisotropy has been suggested since the first papers introducing the concept of High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI). Frank and other authors have proposed using this approach to better quantify anisotropy of the apparent diffusion coefficient profile and classify white matter complexity [3-4-5-6]. In this study, building on this idea, we present a new index that, instead of quantifying diffusion anisotropy from a HARDI signal, measures the total power of the spherical harmonics coefficients encoding only the anisotropy information of the signal or, in short, it measures the anisotropic power (AP) of the signal. The aim of this index is to provide a simple, robust to noise and model independent measure that can be used to better characterize biological tissues and also potentially detect changes in low anisotropy regions that normally are not distinguishable from CSF regions or noise with standard anisotropy indices. Theory If al,m are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the HARDI signal normalized to the non-diffusion weighted signal (S=Sdwi/Sb0), the AP index can be defined as the sum of the angular power spectrum of each harmonic of even order l ≥ 2 as: = = 1 22 + 1 ,, ,,,,,… Figure 1, shows as an example of the AP index evaluated for increasing harmonic orders on a HARDI signal defined by a diffusion tensor ranging from [2.1 0.0 0.0] to [0.7 0.7 0.7] x10-3 mm 2 /s. Data was simulated with a value of b-value of 3000 s/mm 2 and 80 directions to fit SH orders up to l=10. The figure shows that most of the anisotropic power is captured by an AP evaluated up to order 6. Higher orders, even for the high b-value applied, don't contribute significantly to the final AP value. Due to the exponential relation between the MR signal and diffusivity, and since AP describes an un-normalised signal power, a convenient way to express this index is to use a neper scale: = ln (((((⁄) where APref can be a reference power (e.g. a fully anisotropic tensor [2.0 0.0 0.0] x10-3 mm 2 /s). In-vivo data. In order to compare AP measures with conventional anisotropy maps, 5 datasets from healthy subjects were acquired using a 3T GE MR750 system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with the following parameters: voxel size 2.0x2.0x2.0 mm, 128x128 matrix, 70 slices, TE 76.6 ms, b-value 3000 s/mm 2 , 60 diffusion-weighted directions and 7 non-diffusion-weighted volumes using a spin-echo EPI sequence. Following correction for motion and eddy current distortion FA, GFA (based on qBall-ODF [7]), Generalized Anisotropy (GA)[4,5] and AP maps were estimated for each dataset. Results Figure 2 shows a comparison between different anisotropy maps and the AP(np) maps calculated up to order 6 for one of the subjects (similar results were obtained for all subjects). While anisotropy maps reveal white matter and thalamic regions, AP maps are able to detect anisotropic power contributions also from grey matter regions in the cortex and in the caudate close to the ventricles (arrow). At the same time, AP maps are able to efficiently suppress any signal or noise from CSF regions (i.e. no signal power in even SH orders l ≥ 2). Figure 3 shows a comparison between the AP map and a T1 weighted structural image obtained from the same subject. Both images are able to separate white and grey matter structures similarly confirming that the AP index correctly discriminates between CSF and low anisotropic tissues. Discussion and Conclusions All the anisotropy information in a HARDI signal is captured by the spherical harmonic coefficients of even order l ≥ 2. By measuring the total power of these coefficients it is possible to obtain an absolute measure of how much anisotropy information is contained in each HARDI signal and use this to better quantify and discriminate low anisotropy gray matter regions from CSF regions or noise. This measure is entirely model independent and particularly robust to noise as it can be obtained directly by the sum of the angular power spectrum of the first few SH coefficients of even order (i.e. l=2,4,6). These maps are relatively easy to extract from any existing HARDI dataset acquired with more than 30 directions (28 is the minimum required to fit SH of order 6). Since the AP map quantify how much anisotropy information is effectively available in each a voxel, this measure can be potentially useful to detect very small microstructural changes in low anisotropic regions beyond white matter. Also, these maps can be used to better calibrate or fine tune HARDI methods to extract fibre orientation distributions only in voxels with enough anisotropic signal power. Finally, the similar image contrast compared to structural images also makes the AP an ideal map to use when registering diffusion data to structural images.},

  abstract = {The neural architecture of the white matter of the brain, obtained using tractography algorithms, can be divided into different tracts. Their function is, in many cases, still an object of study and might be affected in some syndromes or conditions. Obtaining a reproducible and correct segmentation is therefore crucial both in clinics and in research. However, it is difficult to obtain due to the huge number of fibers and high inter-subject variability. In this paper, we propose to segment and recognize tracts by directly modeling their anatomical definitions, which are usually based on relationships between structures. Since these definitions are mainly qualitative, we propose to model their intrinsic vagueness using fuzzy spatial relations and combine them into a single quantitative score mapped to each fiber. To cope with the high redundancy of tractograms and ease interpretation, we also take advantage of a simplification scheme based on a multi-resolution representation. This allows for an interactive and real-time navigation through different levels of detail. We illustrate our method using the Human Connectome Project dataset and compare it to other well-known white matter segmentation techniques.},

  abstract = {High angular resolution diffusion imaging has recently been of great interest in characterizing non-Gaussian diffusion processes. One important goal is to obtain more accurate fits of the apparent diffusion processes in these non-Gaussian regions, thus overcoming the limitations of classical diffusion tensor imaging. This paper presents an extensive study of high-order models for apparent diffusion coefficient estimation and illustrates some of their applications. Using a meaningful modified spherical harmonics basis to capture the physical constraints of the problem, a new regularization algorithm is proposed. The new smoothing term is based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator and its closed form implementation is used in the fitting procedure. Next, the linear transformation between the coefficients of a spherical harmonic series of order ℓ and independent elements of a rank-ℓ high-order diffusion tensor is explicitly derived. This relation allows comparison of the state-of-the-art anisotropy measures computed from spherical harmonics and tensor coefficients. Published results are reproduced accurately and it is also possible to recover voxels with isotropic, single fiber anisotropic, and multiple fiber anisotropic diffusion. Validation is performed on apparent diffusion coefficients from synthetic data, from a biological phantom, and from a human brain dataset. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {We propose a regularized, fast, and robust analytical solution for the Q-ball imaging (QBI) reconstruction of the orientation distribution function (ODF) together with its detailed validation and a discussion on its benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical simplification of the Funk-Radon transform which approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the Funk-Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then, we show that the Laplace-Beltrami regularization is theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing angular resolution, the Laplace-Beltrami regularization reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber detection while reducing angular error in the ODF maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative validation is performed against ground truth from synthetic data and against real data from a biological phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our technique is also able to recover known fiber crossings in the human brain and provides the practical advantage of being up to 15 times faster than original numerical QBI method. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Precise localization of sulco-gyral structures of the human cerebral cortex is important for the interpretation of morpho-functional data, but requires anatomical expertise and is time consuming because of the brain's geometric complexity. Software developed to automatically identify sulco-gyral structures has improved substantially as a result of techniques providing topologically correct reconstructions permitting inflated views of the human brain. Here we describe a complete parcellation of the cortical surface using standard internationally accepted nomenclature and criteria. This parcellation is available in the FreeSurfer package. First, a computer-assisted hand parcellation classified each vertex as sulcal or gyral, and these were then subparcellated into 74 labels per hemisphere. Twelve datasets were used to develop rules and algorithms (reported here) that produced labels consistent with anatomical rules as well as automated computational parcellation. The final parcellation was used to build an atlas for automatically labeling the whole cerebral cortex. This atlas was used to label an additional 12 datasets, which were found to have good concordance with manual labels. This paper presents a precisely defined method for automatically labeling the cortical surface in standard terminology.},

  abstract = {Brain tumour identification with traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tends to be time-consuming and in most cases, reading of the resulting images by human agents is prone to error, making it desirable to use automated image segmentation. This is a multi-step process involving: (a) collecting data in the form of raw processed or raw images, (b) removing bias by using pre-processing, (c) processing the image and locating the brain tumour, and (d) showing the tumour affected areas on a computer screen or projector. Several systems have been proposed for medical image segmentation but have not been evaluated in the field. This may be due to ongoing issues of image clarity, grey and white matter present in a scan image, lack of knowledge of the end user and constraints arising from MRI imaging systems. This makes it imperative to develop a comprehensive technique for the accurate diagnosis of brain tumors in MRI images. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy consisting of 'Data, Image segmentation processing, and View' (DIV) which are the major components required to develop a high-end system for brain tumour diagnosis based on deep learning neural networks. The DIV taxonomy is evaluated based on system completeness and acceptance. The utility of the DIV taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying 30 state-of-the-art publications in the domain of medFical image segmentation systems based on deep neural networks. The results demonstrate that few components of medical image segmentation systems have been validated although several have been evaluated by identifying role and efficiency of the components in this domain.

  abstract = {Ever since the introduction of the concept of fiber tractography, methods to generate better and more plausible tractograms have become available. Many modern methods can handle complex fiber architecture and take on a probabilistic approach to account for different sources of uncertainty. The resulting tractogram from any such method typically represents a finite random sample from a complex distribution of possible tracks. Generating a higher amount of tracks allows for a more accurate depiction of the underlying distribution. The recently proposed method of track-density imaging (TDI) allows to capture the spatial distribution of a tractogram. In this work, we propose an extension of TDI towards the 5D spatio-angular domain, which we name track orientation density imaging (TODI). The proposed method aims to capture the full track orientation distribution (TOD). Just as the TDI map, the TOD is amenable to spatial super-resolution (or even sub-resolution), but in addition also to angular super-resolution. Through experiments on in vivo human subject data, an in silico numerical phantom and a challenging tractography phantom, we found that the TOD presents an increased amount of regional spatio-angular consistency, as compared to the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) from constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD). Furthermore, we explain how the amplitude of the TOD of a short-tracks distribution (i.e. where the track length is limited) can be interpreted as a measure of track-like local support (TLS). This in turn motivated us to explore the idea of TOD-based fiber tractography. In such a setting, the short-tracks TOD is able to guide a track along directions that are more likely to correspond to continuous structure over a longer distance. This powerful concept is shown to greatly robustify targeted as well as whole-brain tractography. We conclude that the TOD is a versatile tool that can be cast in many different roles and scenarios in the expanding domain of fiber tractography based methods and their applications. © 2013 The Authors.},

MSMT-CSD can resolve WM, GM and CSF signal contributions, but requires multi-shell data. Very recently, we proposed a novel method that can achieve the same results using just single-shell data. We refer to this method as "single-shell 3-tissue CSD" (SS3T-CSD). Both MSMT-CSD and SS3T-CSD require WM, GM and CSF response functions. These can be obtained from manually selected exemplary voxels of the tissue classes, or via the procedure described initially in the MSMT-CSD paper, which relies on a highly accurately co-registered T1 image. We propose an unsupervised procedure that does not depend on a T1 image, nor registration, and works for both single-shell and multi-shell data.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI has provided the neuroimaging community with a powerful tool to acquire in-vivo data sensitive to microstructural features of white matter, up to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than typical voxel sizes. The key to extracting such valuable information lies in complex modelling techniques, which form the link between the rich diffusion MRI data and various metrics related to the microstructural organization. Over time, increasingly advanced techniques have been developed, up to the point where some diffusion MRI models can now provide access to properties specific to individual fibre populations in each voxel in the presence of multiple “crossing” fibre pathways. While highly valuable, such fibre-specific information poses unique challenges for typical image processing pipelines and statistical analysis. In this work, we review the “Fixel-Based Analysis” (FBA) framework, which implements bespoke solutions to this end. It has recently seen a stark increase in adoption for studies of both typical (healthy) populations as well as a wide range of clinical populations. We describe the main concepts related to Fixel-Based Analyses, as well as the methods and specific steps involved in a state-of-the-art FBA pipeline, with a focus on providing researchers with practical advice on how to interpret results. We also include an overview of the scope of all current FBA studies, categorized across a broad range of neuro-scientific domains, listing key design choices and summarizing their main results and conclusions. Finally, we critically discuss several aspects and challenges involved with the FBA framework, and outline some directions and future opportunities.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To improve image registration accuracy in neurodegenerative populations. Materials and Methods: This study used primary progressive aphasia, aged control, and young control T1-weighted images. Mapping to a template image was performed using single-channel Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), a dual-channel method with ventricular anatomy in the second channel, and a dual-channel with appendage method, which utilized a priori knowledge of template ventricular anatomy in the deformable atlas. Results: Our results indicated substantial improvement in the registration accuracy over single-contrast-based brain mapping, mainly in the lateral ventricles and regions surrounding them. Dual-channel mapping significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) reduced the number of misclassified lateral ventricle voxels (based on a manually defined reference) over single-channel mapping. The dual-channel (w/appendage) method further reduced (P {$<$} 0.001) misclassification over the dual-channel method, indicating that the appendage provides more accurate anatomical correspondence for deformation. Conclusion: Brain anatomical mapping by shape normalization is widely used for quantitative anatomical analysis. However, in many geriatric and neurodegenerative disorders, severe tissue atrophy poses a unique challenge for accurate mapping of voxels, especially around the lateral ventricles. In this study we demonstrate our ability to improve mapping accuracy by incorporating ventricular anatomy in LDDMM and by utilizing a priori knowledge of ventricular anatomy in the deformable atlas.

Using clinical data, this paper reports the results of a comparison of the accuracy and performance among several non-rigid registration methods for handling brain deformation. A new adaptive method that automatically removes mesh elements in the area of the resected tumor, thereby handling deformation in the presence of resection is presented.

  abstract = {Fiber tractography is widely used to non-invasively map white-matter bundles in vivo using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). As it is the case for all scientific methods, proper validation is a key prerequisite for the successful application of fiber tractography, be it in the area of basic neuroscience or in a clinical setting. It is well-known that the indirect estimation of the fiber tracts from the local diffusion signal is highly ambiguous and extremely challenging. Furthermore, the validation of fiber tractography methods is hampered by the lack of a real ground truth, which is caused by the extremely complex brain microstructure that is not directly observable non-invasively and that is the basis of the huge network of long-range fiber connections in the brain that are the actual target of fiber tractography methods. As a substitute for in vivo data with a real ground truth that could be used for validation, a widely and successfully employed approach is the use of synthetic phantoms. In this work, we are providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in the area of physical and digital phantoms, answering the following guiding questions: “What are dMRI phantoms and what are they good for?”, “What would the ideal phantom for validation fiber tractography look like?” and “What phantoms, phantom datasets and tools used for their creation are available to the research community?”. We will further discuss the limitations and opportunities that come with the use of dMRI phantoms, and what future direction this field of research might take.},

Recent studies have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to extract white matter fibers and the diffusion coefficients derived from MR processing to provide useful, non-invasive insights into the extent of tumor invasion, axonal integrity, and gross differentiation of glioma from metastasis. Here, we extend this work by examining whether a tract-based analysis can improve non-invasive localization of tumor impact on white matter integrity. This study retrospectively analyzed preoperative magnetic resonance sequences highlighting contrast enhancement and DTI scans of 13 subjects that were biopsy-confirmed to have either high or low-grade glioma. We reconstructed the corticospinal tract and superior longitudinal fasciculus by applying atlas-based regions of interest to fibers derived from whole-brain deterministic streamline tractography. Within-subject comparison of hemispheric diffusion coefficients (e.g., fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) indicated higher levels of white matter degradation in the ipsilesional hemisphere. Novel application of along-tract analyses revealed that tracts traversing the tumor region showed significant white matter degradation compared to the contralesional hemisphere and ipsilesional tracts displaced by the tumor.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel large deformation diffeomorphic registration algorithm to align high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) characterized by Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF). Our proposed algorithm seeks an optimal diffeomorphism of large deformation between two ODF fields in a spatial volume domain and at the same time, locally reorients an ODF in a manner such that it remains consistent with the surrounding anatomical structure. We first extend ODFs traditionally defined in a unit sphere to a generalized ODF defined in R3. This makes it easy for an affine transformation as well as a diffeomorphic group action to be applied on the ODF. We then construct a Riemannian space of the generalized ODFs and incorporate its Riemannian metric for the similarity of ODFs into a variational problem defined under the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) framework. We finally derive the gradient of the cost function in both Riemannian spaces of diffeomorphisms and the generalized ODFs, and present its numerical implementation. Both synthetic and real brain HARDI data are used to illustrate the performance of our registration algorithm.},

  abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRIs) is a key step for population studies, or construction of brain atlases, among other important tasks. Given the high dimensionality of the data, registration is usually performed by relying on scalar representative images, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, thereby ignoring much of the directional information conveyed by DW-MR datasets itself. Alternatively, model-based registration algorithms have been proposed to exploit information on the preferred fiber orientation(s) at each voxel. Models such as the diffusion tensor or orientation distribution function (ODF) have been used for this purpose. Tensor-based registration methods rely on a model that does not completely capture the information contained in DW-MRIs, and largely depends on the accurate estimation of tensors. ODF-based approaches are more recent and computationally challenging, but also better describe complex fiber configurations thereby potentially improving the accuracy of DW-MRI registration. A new algorithm based on angular interpolation of the diffusion-weighted volumes was proposed for affine registration, and does not rely on any specific local diffusion model. In this work, we first extensively compare the performance of registration algorithms based on (i) angular interpolation, (ii) non-diffusion-weighted scalar volume (b0), and (iii) diffusion tensor image (DTI). Moreover, we generalize the concept of angular interpolation (AI) to non-linear image registration, and implement it in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We demonstrate that AI registration of DW-MRIs is a powerful alternative to volume and tensor-based approaches. In particular, we show that AI improves the registration accuracy in many cases over existing state-of-the-art algorithms, while providing registered raw DW-MRI data, which can be used for any subsequent analysis. © 2013 Duarte-Carvajalino, Sapiro, Harel and Lenglet.},

  abstract = {Non-rigid registration algorithms have been proposed over the years to register medical images to each other. One class of applications for these algorithms is the automatic segmentation of structures and substructures using a predefined atlas. But these algorithms have been limited to image volumes without gross abnormalities or pathologies and have thus been of limited use for applications such as the automatic segmentation of radiation sensitive structures for radiation therapy planning. The algorithm we present in this paper is an extension of a non-rigid registration algorithm we have previously developed (the Adaptive Basis Algorithm). This extension permits the use of the algorithm for the automatic segmentation of medical images even when structures have been displaced substantially. The algorithm automatically adjusts the stiffness of the transformation to permit larger displacements over regions that are known to be very compliant and smaller displacements over regions that are known to be less compliant. The stiffness map can be defined once and for all in an atlas. The algorithm has been tested and evaluated on head image volumes with large ventricular enlargements and head image volumes with large space-occupying lesions. © 2004 IEEE.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: The somatotopic organization of the motor fibers within the posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC) in humans remains unclear. Several electrophysiological atlases created from stimulation during stereotactic neurosurgery have suggested that there is considerable overlap between representations of body parts. Overlap reported in these studies may have been due to linear scaling methods applied to the data that were unable to account for individual anatomical variability. In the current work, the authors attempted to overcome these limitations by using a nonlinear registration technique to better understand the spatial location and extent of the body-part representations in the IC. METHODS: Data were acquired during 30 cases of deep brain neurosurgery in which the IC was electrically stimulated to localize the ventrolateral nucleus for a subsequent thalamotomy or implantation of a thalamic deep brain stimulator. Motor responses from the tongue, face, arm, or leg were evoked in the IC and coded in the patient's native MR imaging space. The tagged MR images were then nonlinearly registered to a high-resolution template MR image. This work resulted in a functional electrophysiological atlas demonstrating the locations of body-part representations in the posterior limb of the IC that takes individual anatomical variability into account. To further understand the spatial location and extent of the motor responses, the electrophysiological data points were transformed into 3D probability maps that describe the likelihood of obtaining motor responses in the posterior limb of the IC. RESULTS: The analyses suggest a reliable face-anterior, arm-intermediate, and leg-posterior somatotopic organization in the posterior limb of the IC with little overlap between the body-part representations. CONCLUSIONS: This probabilistic atlas of functional responses evoked by stimulating the posterior limb of the IC provides better understanding of the anatomical organization of descending motor fibers, can be used for indirect intraoperative confirmation of the location of the ventrolateral thalamus, and is applicable to clinical and research MR imaging studies requiring information on spatial organization of motor fibers at the thalamic level in the human brain.},

The authors used intraoperative subcortical stimulation in awake patients undergoing operation for a glioma in the left dominant hemisphere to map the language pathways and to determine the contribution of such a method to surgical results. Methods. One hundred fifteen patients harboring a World Health Organization Grade II glioma within language areas underwent operation after induction of local anesthesia, using direct electrical stimulation to perform online cortical and subcortical language mapping throughout the resection. Results. After detection of cortical language sites, the authors identified 1 or several of the following subcortical language pathways in all patients: 1) arcuate fasciculus, eliciting phonemic paraphasia when stimulated; 2) inferior frontooccipital fasciculus, generating semantic paraphasia when stimulated; 3) subcallosal fasciculus, inducing transcortical motor aphasia during stimulation; 4) frontoparietal phonological loop, eliciting speech apraxia during stimulation; and 5) fibers coming from the ventral premotor cortex, inducing anarthria when stimulated. These structures were preserved, representing the limits of the resection. Despite a transient immediate postoperative worsening, all but 2 patients (98\%) returned to baseline or better. On control MR imaging, 83\% of resections were total or subtotal. Conclusions. These results represent the largest experience with human subcortical language mapping ever reported. The use of intraoperative cortical and subcortical stimulation gives a unique opportunity to perform an accurate and reliable real-time anatomofunctional study of language connectivity. Such knowledge of the individual organization of language networks enables practitioners to optimize the benefit-to-risk ratio of surgery for Grade II glioma within the left dominant hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Surgery is the first treatment in neuro-oncology. However, brain gliomas are frequently located within eloquent areas. Therefore, in order to maximize the extent of resection while preserving cerebral functions, owing to major interindividual anatomo-functional variability across patients, functional mapping is now mandatory. Preoperative functional neuroimaging allows a better understanding of the individual organization of brain networks, leading to optimized surgical indications and planning. Intrasurgical cortical and subcortical stimulation, often carried out in awake patients, enables assessment of the performance of online anatomo-functional correlations, with increased resection according to functional boundaries. Postoperative functional neuroimaging following recovery, regularly carried out after active rehabilitation, provides information regarding cerebral plasticity over time, possibly opening the door to another surgery(ies). In summary, brain mapping allows surgical removal in eloquent areas classically considered as 'inoperable', and also preservation or even improvement of quality of life, while increasing median survival. The future persepctive is now to move towards dynamic therapeutic strategy based on a multiple-stage surgical approach, combined with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. In addition, cerebral mapping enables a better knowledge of brain processing, especially concerning connectivity and plasticity, creating a link between neuro-oncology and cognitive neurosciences, and opening the concept of 'functional neuro-oncology'. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.},

  abstract = {Preterm birth disrupts and alters the complex developmental processes in the cerebral cortex. This disruption may be a contributing factor to widespread delay and cognitive difficulties in the preterm population. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that makes inferences about cellular structures, at scales smaller than the imaging resolution. One established finding is that DW MRI shows a transient radial alignment in the preterm cortex. In this study, we quantify this maturational process with the “radiality index”, a parameter that measures directional coherence, which we expect to change rapidly in the perinatal period. To measure this index, we used structural T2-weighted MRI to segment the cortex and generate cortical meshes. We obtained normal vectors for each face of the mesh and compared them to the principal diffusion direction, calculated by both the DTI and DIAMOND models, to generate the radiality index. The subjects included in this study were 89 infants born at fewer than 34 weeks completed gestation, each imaged at up to four timepoints between 27 and 42 weeks gestational age. In this manuscript, we quantify the longitudinal trajectory of radiality, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity from the DTI and DIAMOND models. For the radiality index and fractional anisotropy, the DIAMOND model offers improved sensitivity over the DTI model. The radiality index has a consistent progression across time, with the rate of change depending on the cortical lobe. The occipital lobe changes most rapidly, and the frontal and temporal least: this is commensurate with known developmental anatomy. Analysing the radiality index offers information complementary to other diffusion parameters.},

However, there are applications where samples\textasciitilde (or measurements) are not taken over the predefined grid due to nature of the signal and/or acquisition set-up. To support such applications, the proposed IRF method enables accurate computation of SHTs of signals with randomly distributed sufficient number of samples. In order to improve the accuracy of the computation of the SHT, we also present the so-called multi-pass IRF which adds multiple iterative passes to the IRF. We analyse the multi-pass IRF for different sampling schemes and for different size partitions. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate that the multi-pass IRF allows sufficiently accurate computation of SHTs.},

Spherical signals with multiple peaks naturally arise in Diffusion MRI (dMRI), where each voxel consists of one or more signal sources corresponding to anisotropic tissue structure such as white matter. Due to spatial and spectral partial voluming, clinically-feasible dMRI struggles to resolve crossing-fiber white matter configurations, leading to extensive development in spherical deconvolution methodology to recover underlying fiber directions. However, these methods are typically linear and struggle with small crossing-angles and partial volume fraction estimation. In this work, we improve on current methodologies by nonlinearly estimating fiber structures via self-supervised spherical convolutional networks with guaranteed equivariance to spherical rotation. We perform validation via extensive single and multi-shell synthetic benchmarks demonstrating competitive performance against common baselines. We further show improved downstream performance on fiber tractography measures on the Tractometer benchmark dataset.

  abstract = {Background Surgical resection of high-grade gliomas (HGG) is standard therapy because it imparts significant progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, HGG-tumor margins are indistinguishable from normal brain during surgery. Hence intraoperative technology such as fluorescence (ALA, fluorescein) and intraoperative ultrasound (IoUS) and MRI (IoMRI) has been deployed. This study compares the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies. Methods Critical literature review and meta-analyses, using MEDLINE/PubMed service. The list of references in each article was double-checked for any missing references. We included all studies that reported the use of ALA, fluorescein (FLCN), IoUS or IoMRI to guide HGG-surgery. The meta-analyses were conducted according to statistical heterogeneity between studies. If there was no heterogeneity, fixed effects model was used; otherwise, a random effects model was used. Statistical heterogeneity was explored by χ2 and inconsistency (I2) statistics. To assess cost-effectiveness, we calculated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results Gross total resection (GTR) after ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI was 69.1\%, 84.4\%, 73.4\% and 70\% respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. All four techniques led to significant prolongation of PFS and tended to prolong OS. However none of these technologies led to significant prolongation of OS compared to controls. The cost/QALY was \$16,218, \$3181, \$6049 and \$32,954 for ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI respectively. Conclusions ALA, FLCN, IoUS and IoMRI significantly improve GTR and PFS of HGG. Their incremental cost was below the threshold for cost-effectiveness of HGG-therapy, denoting that each intraoperative technology was cost-effective on its own.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is commonly used in neurosurgical practice but is largely limited to the preoperative setting. This is due primarily to image degradation caused by susceptibility artifact when conventional single-shot (SS) echo-planar imaging (EPI) DTI (SS-DTI) is acquired for open cranial, surgical position intraoperative DTI (iDTI). Readout-segmented (RS) EPI DTI (RS-DTI) has been reported to reduce such artifact but has not yet been evaluated in the intraoperative MRI (iMRI) environment. The authors evaluated the performance of RS versus SS EPI for DTI of the human brain in the iMRI setting. METHODS: Pre- and intraoperative 3-T 3D T1-weighted and 2D multislice RS-iDTI (called RESOLVE [readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains] on the Siemens platform) and SS-iDTI images were acquired in 22 adult patients undergoing intraaxial iMRI resections for suspected low-grade glioma (14; 64\%), high-grade glioma (7; 32\%), or focal cortical dysplasia. Regional susceptibility artifact, anatomical deviation relative to T1-weighted imaging, and tractographic output for surgically relevant tracts were compared between iDTI sequences as well as the intraoperative tract shifts from preoperative DTI. RESULTS: RS-iDTI resulted in qualitatively less regional susceptibility artifact (resection cavity, orbitofrontal and anterior temporal cortices) and mean anatomical deviation in regions most prone to susceptibility artifact (RS-iDTI 2.7 ± 0.2 vs SS-iDTI 7.5 ± 0.4 mm) compared to SS-iDTI. Although tract reconstruction success did not significantly differ by DTI method, susceptibility artifact-related tractography failure (of at least 1 surgically relevant tract) occurred for SS-iDTI in 8/22 (36\%) patients, and in 5 of these 8 patients RS-iDTI permitted successful reconstruction. Among cases with successful tractography for both sequences, maximal intersequence differences were substantial (mean 9.5 ± 5.7 mm, range -27.1 to 18.7 mm). CONCLUSIONS: RS EPI enables higher quality and more accurate DTI for surgically relevant tractography of major white matter tracts in intraoperative, open cranium neurosurgical applications at 3 T.},

  abstract = {Whole-brain diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) at high signal-to-noise ratio and angular and spatial resolutions were utilized to study the effects of age, sex differences, and lateral asymmetries of 6 white matter pathways (arcuate fasciculus [AF], inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus [IFOF], uncinate fasciculus [UF], corticospinal tract [CST], and somatosensory pathway [SS]) in 31 right-handed children (6-17 years). Fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of the orientational variance in water molecular diffusivity, and the magnitude of water diffusivity (parallel, perpendicular, and mean diffusivity) along the pathways were quantified. Three major patterns of maturation were observed: 1) significant increase in FA with age, accompanied by significant decreases in all 3 diffusivities (e.g., left IFOF); 2) significant decreases in all three diffusivities with age without significant changes in FA (e.g., left CST); and 3) no significant age-related changes in FA or diffusivity (e.g., SS). Sex differences were minimal. Many pathways showed lateral asymmetries. In the right hemisphere, the frontotemporal (FT) segment of AF was not visualized in a substantial (29\%) number of participants. FA was higher in the left hemisphere in the FT segment of AF, UF, and CST, whereas it was lower in the frontoparietal segment of AF. This study provides normative data essential for the interpretation of pediatric brain DTT measurements in both health and disease. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews databases. Randomized control trials, case control or cohort studies, and surgical case series published from January 1993 to February 2021 that reported on iMRI-guided epilepsy surgery outcomes for either adults or children were eligible for inclusion. Studies comparing iMRI-guided epilepsy surgery to non-iMRI surgery controls were selected for meta-analysis using random-effects models. Forty-two studies matched the selection criteria and were used for qualitative synthesis and ten of these were suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, studies included various 0.2-3.0 Tesla iMRI systems, contained small numbers with heterogenous clinical characteristics, utilized subjective GTR reporting, and had variable follow-up durations. Meta-analysis demonstrated that the use of iMRI-guidance led to statistically significant higher rates of GTR (RR~=~1.31 [95\% CI~=~1.10-1.57]) and seizure freedom (RR~=~1.44 [95\% CI~=~1.12-1.84]), but this was undermined by moderate to significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (I2~=~55\% and I2~=~71\% respectively). Currently, there is only level III-2 evidence supporting the use of iMRI-guidance over conventional non-iMRI epilepsy surgery, with respect to the studied outcomes.},

  abstract = {Object. Diffusion-based MRI tractography is an imaging tool increasingly used in neurosurgical procedures to generate 3D maps of white matter pathways as an aid to identifying safe margins of resection. The majority of white matter fiber tractography software packages currently available to clinicians rely on a fundamentally flawed framework to generate fiber orientations from diffusion-weighted data, namely diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This work provides the first extensive and systematic exploration of the practical limitations of DTI-based tractography and investigates whether the higher-order tractography model constrained spherical deconvolution provides a reasonable solution to these problems within a clinically feasible timeframe. Methods. Comparison of tractography methodologies in visualizing the corticospinal tracts was made using the diffusion-weighted data sets from 45 healthy controls and 10 patients undergoing presurgical imaging assessment. Tensor-based and constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography methodologies were applied to both patients and controls. Results. Diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography methods (using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography algorithms) substantially underestimated the extent of tracks connecting to the sensorimotor cortex in all participants in the control group. In contrast, the constrained spherical deconvolution tractography method consistently produced the biologically expected fan-shaped configuration of tracks. In the clinical cases, in which tractography was performed to visualize the corticospinal pathways in patients with concomitant risk of neurological deficit following neurosurgical resection, the constrained spherical deconvolution-based and tensor-based tractography methodologies indicated very different apparent safe margins of resection; the constrained spherical deconvolution-based method identified corticospinal tracts extending to the entire sensorimotor cortex, while the tensor-based method only identified a narrow subset of tracts extending medially to the vertex. Conclusions. This comprehensive study shows that the most widely used clinical tractography method (diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography) results in systematically unreliable and clinically misleading information. The higher-order tractography model, using the same diffusion-weighted data, clearly demonstrates fiber tracts more accurately, providing improved estimates of safety margins that may be useful in neurosurgical procedures. We therefore need to move beyond the diffusion tensor framework if we are to begin to provide neurosurgeons with biologically reliable tractography information. © AANS, 2013.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravoxel incoherent motion MRI has been proposed as an alternative method to measure brain perfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters (the perfusion fraction, the pseudodiffusion coefficient, and the flow-related parameter) to differentiate high- and low-grade brain gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were assessed in 21 brain gliomas (16 high-grade, 5 low-grade). Images were acquired by using a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion pulse sequence, with 16 values of b (0-900 s/mm 2) in 3 orthogonal directions on 3T systems equipped with 32 multichannel receiver head coils. The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were derived by fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion biexponential model. Regions of interest were drawn in regions of maximum intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and contralateral control regions. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student t test. In addition, regions of interest were drawn around all whole tumors and were evaluated with the help of histograms. RESULTS: In the regions of maximum perfusion fraction, perfusion fraction was significantly higher in the high-grade group (0.127±0.031) than in the low-grade group (0.084 ± 0.016, P {$<$} .001) and in the contralateral control region (0.061 ± 0.011, P {$<$} .001). No statistically significant difference was observed for the pseudodiffusion coefficient. The perfusion fraction correlated moderately with dynamic susceptibility contrast relative CBV (r=0.59). The histograms of the perfusion fraction showed a "heavy-tailed" distribution for high-grade but not low-grade gliomas. CONCLUSIONS: The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction is helpful for differentiating high- from low-grade brain gliomas.},

Method: The introduced method uses dMRI images for tractography whereas the ROI definition is based on structural T1 MPRAGE MRI templates, without normalization to MNI space. ROIs for five language-relevant fiber bundles were visualized on an axial, coronal, or sagittal view of T1 MPRAGE images. The ROIs were defined based upon the tracts’ obligatory pathways, derived from literature and own experiences in peritumoral tractography. Results: The resulting guideline was evaluated for each fiber bundle in ten healthy subjects and ten patients by one expert and three raters. Overall, 300 ROIs were evaluated and compared. The targeted language fiber bundles could be tracked in 88\% of the ROI pairs, based on the raters’ result blinded ROI placements. The evaluation indicated that the precision of the ROIs did not relate to the varying experience of the raters. Conclusions: Our guideline introduces a standardized language tractography method for routine preoperative workup and for research contexts. The ROI placement guideline based on easy-to-identify anatomical landmarks proved to be user-friendly and accurate, also in inexperienced test persons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-definition fiber tracking (HDFT) is a novel combination of processing, reconstruction, and tractography methods that can track white matter fibers from cortex, through complex fiber crossings, to cortical and subcortical targets with subvoxel resolution. OBJECTIVE: To perform neuroanatomical validation of HDFT and to investigate its neurosurgical applications. METHODS: Six neurologically healthy adults and 36 patients with brain lesions were studied. Diffusion spectrum imaging data were reconstructed with a Generalized Q-Ball Imaging approach. Fiber dissection studies were performed in 20 human brains, and selected dissection results were compared with tractography. RESULTS: HDFT provides accurate replication of known neuroanatomical features such as the gyral and sulcal folding patterns, the characteristic shape of the claustrum, the segmentation of the thalamic nuclei, the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, the multiple fiber crossing at the centrum semiovale, the complex angulation of the optic radiations, the terminal arborization of the arcuate tract, and the cortical segmentation of the dorsal Broca area. From a clinical perspective, we show that HDFT provides accurate structural connectivity studies in patients with intracerebral lesions, allowing qualitative and quantitative white matter damage assessment, aiding in understanding lesional patterns of white matter structural injury, and facilitating innovative neurosurgical applications. High-grade gliomas produce significant disruption of fibers, and low-grade gliomas cause fiber displacement. Cavernomas cause both displacement and disruption of fibers. CONCLUSION: Our HDFT approach provides an accurate reconstruction of white matter fiber tracts with unprecedented detail in both the normal and pathological human brain. Further studies to validate the clinical findings are needed. Copyright © 2012 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.},

Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) was obtained preoperatively in 13 patients with brain tumors ranging from benign to high-grade malignant, including primary and metastatic lesions, and maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). fractional anisotropy (FA). and major eigenvector direction were generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn within identifiable WM tracts affected by tumor, avoiding grossly cystic and necrotic regions, known fiber crossings, and gray matter. Patterns of WM tract alteration were categorized on the basis of qualitative analysis of directional color maps and correlation analysis of ADC and FA. Results: Four basic patterns of WM alteration were identified: 1) normal or nearly normal FA and ADC, with abnormal tract location or tensor directions attributable to bulk mass displacement. 2) moderately decreased FA and increased ADC with normal tract locations and tensor directions, 3) moderately decreased FA and increased ADC with abnormal tensor directions, and 4) near isotropy. FA and ADC were inversely correlated for Patterns 1-3 but did not discriminate edema from infiltrating tumor. However, in the absence of mass displacement, infiltrating tumor was found to produce tensor directional changes that were not observed with vasogenic edema, suggesting the possibility of discrimination on the basis of directional statistics. Conclusion: Tumor alteration of WM tracts tends to produce one of four patterns on FA and directional color maps. Clinical application of these patterns must await further study.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) peak finding methods typically fail to reconstruct fibers crossing at shallow angles below 40°, leading to errors in tractography. ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP) with the biophysical multicompartment diffusion model allows for breaking this barrier. Methods: A randomized mechanism to generate a multidimensional ODF-dictionary that covers biologically plausible ranges of intra- and extra-axonal diffusivities and fraction volumes is introduced. This enables ODF-FP to address the high variability of brain tissue. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on both numerical simulations and a reconstruction of major fascicles from high- and low-resolution in vivo diffusion images. Results: ODF-FP with the suggested modifications correctly identifies fibers crossing at angles as shallow as 10 degrees in the simulated data. In vivo, our approach reaches 56\% of true positives in determining fiber directions, resulting in visibly more accurate reconstruction of pyramidal tracts, arcuate fasciculus, and optic radiations than the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, the estimated diffusivity values and fraction volumes in corpus callosum conform with the values reported in the literature. Conclusion: The modified ODF-FP outperforms commonly used fiber reconstruction methods at shallow angles, which improves deterministic tractography outcomes of major fascicles. In addition, the proposed approach allows for linearization of the microstructure parameters fitting problem.},

However, despite the increasing availability of different diffusion models and tractography algorithms, it remains unclear how to select the optimal fiber reconstruction method, given certain imaging parameters. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to have a quantitative comparison of these models and algorithms and a deeper understanding of the corresponding strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we use a common dataset with known ground truth and a reproducible methodology to quantitatively evaluate the performance of various diffusion models and tractography algorithms. To examine a wide range of methods, the dataset, but not the ground truth, was released to the public for evaluation in a contest, the "Fiber Cup". 10 fiber reconstruction methods were evaluated. The results provide evidence that: 1. For high SNR datasets, diffusion models such as (fiber) orientation distribution functions correctly model the underlying fiber distribution and can be used in conjunction with streamline tractography, and 2. For medium or low SNR datasets, a prior on the spatial smoothness of either the diffusion model or the fibers is recommended for correct modelling of the fiber distribution and proper tractography results. The phantom dataset, the ground truth fibers, the evaluation methodology and the results obtained so far will remain publicly available on: http://www.lnao.fr/spip.php?rubrique79 to serve as a comparison basis for existing or new tractography methods.

  abstract = {Stroke-induced aphasia is associated with adverse effects on quality of life and the ability to return to work. For patients and clinicians the possibility of relying on valid predictors of recovery is an important asset in the clinical management of stroke-related impairment. Age, level of education, type and severity of initial symptoms are established predictors of recovery. However, anatomical predictors are still poorly understood. In this prospective longitudinal study, we intended to assess anatomical predictors of recovery derived from diffusion tractography of the perisylvian language networks. Our study focused on the arcuate fasciculus, a language pathway composed of three segments connecting Wernicke's to Broca's region (i.e. long segment), Wernicke's to Geschwind's region (i.e. posterior segment) and Broca's to Geschwind's region (i.e. anterior segment). In our study we were particularly interested in understanding how lateralization of the arcuate fasciculus impacts on severity of symptoms and their recovery. Sixteen patients (10 males; mean age 60 ± 17 years, range 28-87 years) underwent post stroke language assessment with the Revised Western Aphasia Battery and neuroimaging scanning within a fortnight from symptoms onset. Language assessment was repeated at 6 months. Backward elimination analysis identified a subset of predictor variables (age, sex, lesion size) to be introduced to further regression analyses. A hierarchical regression was conducted with the longitudinal aphasia severity as the dependent variable. The first model included the subset of variables as previously defined. The second model additionally introduced the left and right arcuate fasciculus (separate analysis for each segment). Lesion size was identified as the only independent predictor of longitudinal aphasia severity in the left hemisphere [beta = -0.630, t(-3.129), P = 0.011]. For the right hemisphere, age [beta = -0.678, t(-3.087), P = 0.010] and volume of the long segment of the arcuate fasciculus [beta = 0.730, t(2.732), P = 0.020] were predictors of longitudinal aphasia severity. Adding the volume of the right long segment to the first-level model increased the overall predictive power of the model from 28\% to 57\% [F(1,11) = 7.46, P = 0.02]. These findings suggest that different predictors of recovery are at play in the left and right hemisphere. The right hemisphere language network seems to be important in aphasia recovery after left hemispheric stroke. © 2014 The Author.},

  abstract = {The occipital and frontal lobes are anatomically distant yet functionally highly integrated to generate some of the most complex behaviour. A series of long associative fibres, such as the fronto-occipital networks, mediate this integration via rapid feed-forward propagation of visual input to anterior frontal regions and direct top–down modulation of early visual processing. Despite the vast number of anatomical investigations a general consensus on the anatomy of fronto-occipital connections is not forthcoming. For example, in the monkey the existence of a human equivalent of the ‘inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus’ (iFOF) has not been demonstrated. Conversely, a ‘superior fronto-occipital fasciculus’ (sFOF), also referred to as ‘subcallosal bundle’ by some authors, is reported in monkey axonal tracing studies but not in human dissections. In this study our aim is twofold. First, we use diffusion tractography to delineate the in~vivo anatomy of the sFOF and the iFOF in 30 healthy subjects and three acallosal brains. Second, we provide a comprehensive review of the post-mortem and neuroimaging studies of the fronto-occipital connections published over the last two centuries, together with the first integral translation of Onufrowicz's original description of a human fronto-occipital fasciculus (1887) and Muratoff's report of the ‘subcallosal bundle’ in animals (1893). Our tractography dissections suggest that in the human brain (i) the iFOF is a bilateral association pathway connecting ventro-medial occipital cortex to orbital and polar frontal cortex, (ii) the sFOF overlaps with branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and probably represents an ‘occipital extension’ of the SLF, (iii) the subcallosal bundle of Muratoff is probably a complex tract encompassing ascending thalamo-frontal and descending fronto-caudate connections and is therefore a projection rather than an associative tract. In conclusion, our experimental findings and review of the literature suggest that a ventral pathway in humans, namely the iFOF, mediates a direct communication between occipital and frontal lobes. Whether the iFOF represents a unique human pathway awaits further ad hoc investigations in animals.},

  abstract = {Background:The brain functions as an integrated multi-networked organ. Complex neurocognitive functions are not attributed to a single brain area but depend on the dynamic interactions of distributed brain areas operating in large-scale networks. This is especially important in the field of neurosurgery where intervention within a spatially localized area may indirectly lead to unwanted effects on distant areas. As part of a preliminary integrated work on functional connectivity, we present our initial work on diffusion tensor imaging tractography to produce in vivo white matter tracts dissection.Methods:Diffusion weighted data and high-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from a healthy right-handed volunteer (25 years old) on a whole-body 3 T scanner. Two approaches were used to dissect the tractography results: 1) a standard region of interest technique and 2) the use of Brodmann's area as seeding points, which represents an innovation in terms of seeds initiation.Results:Results are presented as tri-dimensional tractography images. The uncinate fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasiculus, the corticospinal tract, the corpus callosum, the cingulum, and the optic radiations where studied by conventional seeding approach, while Broca's and Wernicke's areas, the primary motor as well as the primary visual cortices were used as seeding areas in the second approach.Conclusions:We report state-of-the-art tractography results of some of the major white matter bundles in a normal subject using DTI. Moreover, we used Brodmann's area as seeding areas for fiber tracts to study the connectivity of known major functional cortical areas., RÉSUMÉContexte:Le cerveau fonctionne comme un organe constitué en multiréseaux intégrés et les fonctions neurocognitives complexes ne sont pas restreintes à une seule zone du cerveau. Elles dépendent d'interactions dynamiques de différentes régions du cerveau opérant en réseaux de grande envergure. Ceci est particulièrement important dans le domaine de la neurochirurgie où une intervention à l'intérieur d'une zone très localisée peut provoquer indirectement des effets indésirables à distance. Nous présentons, dans le cadre d'un travail intégré préliminaire sur la connectivité fonctionnelle, nos travaux initiaux sur la tractographie par IRM de diffusion pour obtenir in vivo la dissection de faisceaux de la substance blanche.Méthode:Des données de l'IRM pondérée en diffusion et des images de haute résolution pondérées en T1 ont été acquises chez un volontaire sain droitier de 25 ans au moyen d'un scanner T3 du corps entier. Deux approches ont été utilisées pour disséquer les résultats de la tractographie: 1) une technique standard ciblant une région spécifique et 2) l'utilisation de la zone de Brodmann comme point d'essaimage, ce qui constitue une innovation.Résultats:Nous présentons des images de tractographie tridimensionnelles. Le faisceau unciné, le faisceau longitudinal inférieur, le faisceau fronto-occipital inférieur, le faisceau pyramidal, le corps calleux, le cingulum et les radiations optiques de Gratiolet ont été étudiés par la méthode d'essaimage conventionnelle alors que les zones de Broca et de Wernicke ainsi que les cortex primaires moteurs et visuels ont été utilisés comme zones d'essaimage dans la deuxième approche.Conclusions:Nous rapportons des résultats de tractographie par IRM de diffusion, une technologie de pointe, de certains des faisceaux importants de la substance blanche chez un sujet normal.

  abstract = {Purpose Brain shift during tumor resection can progressively invalidate the accuracy of neuronavigation systems and affect neurosurgeons' ability to achieve optimal resections. This paper compares two methods that have been presented in the literature to compensate for brain shift: a thin-plate spline deformation model and a finite element method (FEM). For this comparison, both methods are driven by identical sparse data. Specifically, both methods are driven by displacements between automatically detected and matched feature points from intraoperative 3D ultrasound (iUS). Both methods have been shown to be fast enough for intraoperative brain shift correction (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018; Luo et al. in J Med Imaging (Bellingham) 4(3):035003, 2017). However, the spline method requires no preprocessing and ignores physical properties of the brain while the FEM method requires significant preprocessing and incorporates patient-specific physical and geometric constraints. The goal of this work was to explore the relative merits of these methods on recent clinical data. Methods Data acquired during 19 sequential tumor resections in Brigham and Women's Hospital's Advanced Multi-modal Image-Guided Operating Suite between December 2017 and October 2018 were considered for this retrospective study. Of these, 15 cases and a total of 24 iUS to iUS image pairs met inclusion requirements. Automatic feature detection (Machado et al. in Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg 13(10):1525-1538, 2018) was used to detect and match features in each pair of iUS images. Displacements between matched features were then used to drive both the spline model and the FEM method to compensate for brain shift between image acquisitions. The accuracies of the resultant deformation models were measured by comparing the displacements of manually identified landmarks before and after deformation. Results The mean initial subcortical registration error between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image averaged 5.3 ± 0.75 mm. The mean subcortical brain shift, measured using displacements between manually identified landmarks in pairs of iUS images, was 2.5 ± 1.3 mm. Our results showed that FEM was able to reduce subcortical registration error by a small but statistically significant amount (from 2.46 to 2.02 mm). A large variability in the results of the spline method prevented us from demonstrating either a statistically significant reduction in subcortical registration error after applying the spline method or a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods. Conclusions In this study, we observed less subcortical brain shift than has previously been reported in the literature (Frisken et al., in: Miller (ed) Biomechanics of the brain, Springer, Cham, 2019). This may be due to the fact that we separated out the initial misregistration between preoperative MRI and the first iUS image from our brain shift measurements or it may be due to modern neurosurgical practices designed to reduce brain shift, including reduced craniotomy sizes and better control of intracranial pressure with the use of mannitol and other medications. It appears that the FEM method and its use of geometric and biomechanical constraints provided more consistent brain shift correction and better correction farther from the driving feature displacements than the simple spline model. The spline-based method was simpler and tended to give better results for small deformations. However, large variability in the spline results and relatively small brain shift prevented this study from demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the results of the two methods.},

  abstract = {Purpose Readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (rs-EPI) can provide high quality diffusion data because it is less prone to distortion and blurring artifacts than single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI), particularly at higher resolution and higher field. Readout segmentation allows shorter echo-spacing and echo train duration, resulting in reduced image distortion and blurring, respectively, in the phase-encoding direction. However, these benefits come at the expense of longer scan times because the segments are acquired in multiple repetitions times (TRs). This study shortened rs-EPI scan times by reducing the TR duration with simultaneous multislice acceleration. Methods The blipped-CAIPI method for slice acceleration with reduced g-factor SNR loss was incorporated into the diffusion-weighted rs-EPI sequence. The rs- and ss-EPI sequences were compared at a range of resolutions at both 3 and 7 Tesla in terms of image fidelity and diffusion postprocessing results. Results Slice-accelerated clinically useful trace-weighted images and tractography results are presented. Tractography analysis showed that the reduced artifacts in rs-EPI allowed better discrimination of tracts than ss-EPI. Conclusion Slice acceleration reduces rs-EPI scan times providing a practical alternative to diffusion-weighted ss-EPI with reduced distortion and high resolution.

  abstract = {Brain atlases are valuable tools which assist neurosurgeons during the planning of an intervention. Since a printed atlas book has several disadvantages - among them the difficulty to map the information onto a patient's individual anatomy - we have developed a digital version of the well-established stereotaxic brain atlas of Talairach and Tournoux. Our atlas system is mainly dedicated to assist neurosurgical planning, and its benefits are: (i) a three-dimensional (3D) representation of most brain structures contained in the Talairach atlas; (ii) a nonrigid matching capability which warps the standard atlas anatomy to an individual brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset in a few minutes and which is able to take deformations due to tumors into account; (iii) the integration of several sources of neuroanatomical knowledge; (iv) an interface to a navigation system which allows utilization of atlas information intraoperatively. In this paper we outline the algorithm we have developed to achieve 3D surface models of the brain structures. Moreover, we describe the nonrigid matching method which consists of two tasks: firstly, point correspondences between the atlas and the patient are established in an automatic fashion, and secondly these displacement vectors are interpolated using a radial basis function approach to form a continuous transformation function. To generate appropriate target structures for the first of these tasks, we implemented a quick segmentation tool which is capable to segment the cortex and ventricles in less than 5 min. An evaluation shows that our nonrigid approach is more precise than the conventional piecewise linear matching, though it should be further improved for the region around the deep grey nuclei. Summarizing, we developed a Win32 program which permits the convenient and fast application of standardized anatomy to individual brains which potentially contain tumors. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Each QB cluster can be represented by a single centroid streamline; collectively these centroid streamlines can be taken as an effective representation of the tractography. We provide a number of tests to show how the QB reduction has good consistency and robustness. We show how the QB reduction can help in the search for similarities across several subjects.},

  abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing. © 2014 Garyfallidis, Brett, Amirbekian, Rokem, van der Walt, Descoteaux, Nimmo-Smith and Dipy Contributors.},

  abstract = {Virtual dissection of diffusion MRI tractograms is cumbersome and needs extensive knowledge of white matter anatomy. This virtual dissection often requires several inclusion and exclusion regions-of-interest that make it a process that is very hard to reproduce across experts. Having automated tools that can extract white matter bundles for tract-based studies of large numbers of people is of great interest for neuroscience and neurosurgical planning. The purpose of our proposed method, named RecoBundles, is to segment white matter bundles and make virtual dissection easier to perform. This can help explore large tractograms from multiple persons directly in their native space. RecoBundles leverages latest state-of-the-art streamline-based registration and clustering to recognize and extract bundles using prior bundle models. RecoBundles uses bundle models as shape priors for detecting similar streamlines and bundles in tractograms. RecoBundles is 100\% streamline-based, is efficient to work with millions of streamlines and, most importantly, is robust and adaptive to incomplete data and bundles with missing components. It is also robust to pathological brains with tumors and deformations. We evaluated our results using multiple bundles and showed that RecoBundles is in good agreement with the neuroanatomical experts and generally produced more dense bundles. Across all the different experiments reported in this paper, RecoBundles was able to identify the core parts of the bundles, independently from tractography type (deterministic or probabilistic) or size. Thus, RecoBundles can be a valuable method for exploring tractograms and facilitating tractometry studies.},

  abstract = {Purpose: White matter fibre development in childhood involves dynamic changes to microstructural organisation driven by increasing axon diameter, density, and myelination. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies that have quantified advanced diffusion metrics to identify regions of accelerated fibre maturation, particularly across the early pubertal period. We applied a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis (FBA) framework, in order to estimate microscopic and macroscopic white matter changes over time. Methods: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired for 59 typically developing children (27 female) aged 9–13 years at two time-points approximately 16 months apart (time-point 1: 10.4 ± 0.4 years, time-point 2: 11.7 ± 0.5 years). Whole brain FBA was performed using the connectivity-based fixel enhancement method, to assess longitudinal changes in fibre microscopic density and macroscopic morphological measures, and how these changes are related to sex, pubertal stage, and pubertal progression. Follow-up analyses were performed in sub-regions of the corpus callosum to confirm the main findings using a Bayesian repeated measures approach. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in fibre density over time localised to medial and posterior commissural and association fibres, including the forceps major and bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus. Increases in fibre cross-section were substantially more widespread. The rate of fibre development was not associated with age or sex. In addition, there was no significant relationship between pubertal stage or progression and longitudinal fibre development over time. Follow-up Bayesian analyses were performed to confirm the findings, which supported the null effect of the longitudinal pubertal comparison. Conclusion: Using a novel longitudinal fixel-based analysis framework, we demonstrate that white matter fibre density and fibre cross-section increased within a 16-month scan rescan period in specific regions. The observed increases might reflect increasing axonal diameter or axon count. Pubertal stage or progression did not influence the rate of fibre development in the early stages of puberty. Future work should focus on quantifying these measures across a wider age range to capture the full spectrum of fibre development across the pubertal period.},

  abstract = {We propose a linear-elastic registration method to register diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data sets by mapping their diffusion orientation distribution functions (ODFs). The ODFs were reconstructed using a q-ball imaging (QBI) technique to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing. The registration method is based on mapping the ODF maps represented by spherical harmonics which yield analytic solutions and reduce the computational complexity. ODF reorientation is required to maintain the consistency with transformed local fiber directions. The reorientation matrices are extracted from the local Jacobian and directly applied to the coefficients of spherical harmonics. The similarity cost of the registration is defined by the ODF shape distance calculated from the spherical harmonic coefficients. The transformation fields are regularized by linear elastic constraints. The proposed method was validated using both synthetic and real data sets. Experimental results show that the elastic registration improved the affine alignment by further reducing the ODF shape difference; reorientation during the registration produced registered ODF maps with more consistent principle directions compared to registrations without reorientation or simultaneous reorientation. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Neuronavigation based on preoperative imaging data is a ubiquitous tool for image guidance in neurosurgery. However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration. Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift. METHODS: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring due to physical, surgical or biological factors. RESULTS: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention. The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful. CONCLUSION: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.

  abstract = {The arcuate fasciculus has been considered a major dorsal fronto-temporal white matter pathway linking frontal language production regions with auditory perception in the superior temporal gyrus, the so-called Wernicke’s area. In line with this tradition, both historical and contemporary models of language function have assigned primacy to superior temporal projections of the arcuate fasciculus. However, classical anatomical descriptions and emerging behavioural data are at odds with this assumption. On one hand, fronto-temporal projections to Wernicke’s area may not be unique to the arcuate fasciculus. On the other hand, dorsal stream language deficits have been reported also for damage to middle, inferior and basal temporal gyri that may be linked to arcuate disconnection. These findings point to a reappraisal of arcuate projections in the temporal lobe. Here, we review anatomical and functional evidence regarding the temporal cortical terminations of the left arcuate fasciculus by incorporating dissection and tractography findings with stimulation data using cortico–cortical evoked potentials and direct electrical stimulation mapping in awake patients. First, we discuss the fibres of the arcuate fasciculus projecting to the superior temporal gyrus and the functional rostro-caudal gradient in this region where both phonological encoding and auditory-motor transformation may be performed. Caudal regions within the temporoparietal junction may be involved in articulation and associated with temporoparietal projections of the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, while more rostral regions may support encoding of acoustic phonetic features, supported by arcuate fibres. We then move to examine clinical data showing that multimodal phonological encoding is facilitated by projections of the arcuate fasciculus to superior, but also middle, inferior and basal temporal regions. Hence, we discuss how projections of the arcuate fasciculus may contribute to acoustic (middle-posterior superior and middle temporal gyri), visual (posterior inferior temporal/fusiform gyri comprising the visual word form area) and lexical (anterior-middle inferior temporal/fusiform gyri in the basal temporal language area) information in the temporal lobe to be processed, encoded and translated into a dorsal phonological route to the frontal lobe. Finally, we point out surgical implications for this model in terms of the prediction and avoidance of neurological deficit.},

In our review, we gathered converging evidence from brain structure (post-mortem Klingler dissection, in vivo diffusion imaging), function (direct electrical stimulation during awake surgery, cortico-cortical evoked potentials, high resolution electrocorticography) and dysfunction (damage caused by neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, oncological, vascular and epileptic lesions) of this bundle to suggest that the human arcuate fasciculus projects beyond the superior temporal gyrus and includes wider middle, inferior and basal temporal projections. Our model proposes that the arcuate fasciculus would mediate multimodal (acoustic, visual, lexical) phonological encoding within the dorsal route.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The use of high-field intraoperative MRI has been largely studied for the treatment of intracranial tumors in adult patients. In this study, the authors investigated the safety, advantages, and limitations of high-field iMRI for cranial neurosurgical procedures in pediatric patients, with particular attention to craniopharyngiomas and gliomas. METHODS: The authors performed 82 surgical procedures in patients under 16 years of age (range 0.8-15 years) over an 8-year period (2007-2014) using iMRI. The population was divided into 3 groups based on the condition treated: sellar region tumors (Group 1), gliomas (Group 2), and other pathological entities (Group 3). The patients' pre- and postoperative neurological status, the presence of residual tumor, the number of intraoperative scans, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: In Group 1, gross-total resection (GTR) was performed in 22 (88\%) of the procedures and subtotal resection (STR) in 3 (12\%). In Group 2, GTR, STR, and partial resection (PR) were performed, respectively, in 15 (56\%), 7 (26\%), and 5 (18\%) of the procedures. In Group 3, GTR was performed in 28 (93\%) and STR in 2 (7\%) of the procedures. In cases of craniopharyngioma (Group 1) and glioma (Group 2) in which a complete removal was planned, iMRI allowed localization of residual lesions and attainment of the surgical goal through further resection, respectively, in 18\% and 27\% of the procedures. Moreover, in gliomas the resection could be extended from partial to subtotal in 50\% of the cases. In 17\% of the patients in Group 3, iMRI enabled the identification and further removal of tumor remnants. There was no intra- or postoperative complication related to the use of iMRI despite special technical difficulties in smaller children. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the use of iMRI in children proved to be safe. It was most effective in increasing the extent of tumor resection, especially in patients with low-grade gliomas and craniopharyngiomas. The most prominent disadvantage of high-field iMRI was the limitation with respect to operative positioning due to the configuration of the surgical table.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography is often used to estimate structural connections between brain areas and there is a fast-growing interest in quantifying these connections based on their position, shape, size and length. However, a portion of the connections reconstructed with tractography is biased by their position, shape, size and length. Thus, connections reconstructed are not equally distributed in all white matter bundles. Quantitative measures of connectivity based on the streamline distribution in the brain such as streamline count (density), average length and spatial extent (volume) are biased by erroneous streamlines produced by tractography algorithms. In this paper, solutions are proposed to reduce biases in the streamline distribution. First, we propose to optimize tractography parameters in terms of connectivity. Then, we propose to relax the tractography stopping criterion with a novel probabilistic stopping criterion and a particle filtering method, both based on tissue partial volume estimation maps calculated from a T1-weighted image. We show that optimizing tractography parameters, stopping and seeding strategies can reduce the biases in position, shape, size and length of the streamline distribution. These tractography biases are quantitatively reported using in-vivo and synthetic data. This is a critical step towards producing tractography results for quantitative structural connectivity analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive human neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain. Numerous methodological advances have also occurred, though inertia has slowed their adoption. This paper presents an integrated approach to data acquisition, analysis and sharing that builds upon recent advances, particularly from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The 'HCP-style' paradigm has seven core tenets: (i) collect multimodal imaging data from many subjects; (ii) acquire data at high spatial and temporal resolution; (iii) preprocess data to minimize distortions, blurring and temporal artifacts; (iv) represent data using the natural geometry of cortical and subcortical structures; (v) accurately align corresponding brain areas across subjects and studies; (vi) analyze data using neurobiologically accurate brain parcellations; and (vii) share published data via user-friendly databases. We illustrate the HCP-style paradigm using existing HCP data sets and provide guidance for future research. Widespread adoption of this paradigm should accelerate progress in understanding the brain in health and disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECT: Nowadays the role of microsurgical management of intrinsic brain tumors is to maximize the volumetric resection of the tumoral tissue, minimizing the postoperative morbidity. The purpose of this paper was to study the benefits of an original protocol developed for the microsurgical treatment of tumors located in eloquent motor areas where the navigation and electrical stimulation of motor subcortical pathways have been implemented. METHODS: A total of 17 patients who underwent resection of cortical or subcortical tumors in motor areas have been included in the series. The preoperative planning for multimodal navigation was done by integrating anatomical studies, motor functional MR (fMR) imaging, and subcortical pathway volumes generated by diffusion tensor (DT) imaging. Intraoperative neuromonitoring included motor mapping by direct cortical stimulation (CS) and subcortical stimulation (sCS), and localization of the central sulcus by using cortical multipolar electrodes and the N20 wave inversion technique. The location of all cortically and subcortically stimulated points with positive motor response was stored in the navigator and correlated with the cortical and subcortical motor functional structures defined preoperatively. RESULTS: The mean tumoral volumetric resection was 89.1 +/- 14.2\% of the preoperative volume, with a total resection ({$>$} or = 100\%) in 8 patients. Preoperatively a total of 58.8\% of the patients had some kind of motor neurological deficit, increasing 24 hours after surgery to 70.6\% and decreasing to 47.1\% at 1 month later. There was a great correlation between anatomical and functional data, both cortically and subcortically. A total of 52 cortical points submitted to CS had positive motor response, with a positive correlation of 83.7\%. Also, a total of 55 subcortical points had positive motor response; in these cases the mean distance from the stimulated point to the subcortical tract was 7.3 +/- 3.1 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of anatomical and functional studies allows a safe functional resection of the brain tumors located in eloquent areas. Multimodal navigation allows integration and correlation among preoperative and intraoperative anatomical and functional data. Cortical motor functional areas are anatomically and functionally located preoperatively thanks to MR and fMR imaging and subcortical motor pathways with DT imaging and tractography. Intraoperative confirmation is done with CS and N20 inversion wave for cortical structures and with sCS for subcortical pathways. With this protocol the authors achieved a good volumetric resection in cortical and subcortical tumors located in eloquent motor areas, with an increase in the incidence of neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period that significantly decreased 1 month later. Ongoing studies must define the safe limits for functional resection, taking into account the intraoperative brain shift. Finally, it must be demonstrated whether this protocol has any long-term benefit for patients by prolonging the disease-free interval, the time to recurrence, or the survival time.},

The proposed method is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that incorporates a glioma growth model for atlas seeding, a process which modifies the original atlas into one with tumor and edema adapted to best match a given set of patient's images. The modified atlas is registered into the patient space and utilized for estimating the posterior probabilities of various tissue labels.

Hence, in addition to segmentation, the proposed method results in atlas registration and a low-dimensional description of the patient scans through estimation of tumor model parameters. We validate the method by automatically segmenting 10 MR scans and comparing the results to those produced by clinical experts and two state-of-the-art methods. The resulting segmentations of tumor and edema outperform the results of the reference methods, and achieve a similar accuracy from a second human rater. We additionally apply the method to 122 patients scans and report the estimated tumor model parameters and their relations with segmentation and registration results. Based on the results from this patient population, we construct a statistical atlas of the glioma by inverting the estimated deformation fields to warp the tumor segmentations of patients scans into a common space. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Estimation of brain deformation is crucial during neurosurgery. Whilst mechanical characterisation captures stress–strain relationships of tissue, biomechanical models are limited by experimental conditions. This results in variability reported in the literature. The aim of this work was to demonstrate a generative model of strain energy density functions can estimate the elastic properties of tissue using observed brain deformation. Methods: For the generative model a Gaussian Process regression learns elastic potentials from 73 manuscripts. We evaluate the use of neo-Hookean, Mooney–Rivlin and 1-term Ogden meta-models to guarantee stability. Single and multiple tissue experiments validate the ability of our generative model to estimate tissue properties on a synthetic brain model and in eight temporal lobe resection cases where deformation is observed between pre- and post-operative images. Results: Estimated parameters on a synthetic model are close to the known reference with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm between surface nodes for single and multiple tissue experiments. In clinical cases, we were able to recover brain deformation from pre- to post-operative images reducing RMSE of differences from 1.37 to 1.08 mm on the ventricle surface and from 5.89 to 4.84 mm on the resection cavity surface. Conclusion: Our generative model can capture uncertainties related to mechanical characterisation of tissue. When fitting samples from elastography and linear studies, all meta-models performed similarly. The Ogden meta-model performed the best on hyperelastic studies. We were able to predict elastic parameters in a reference model on a synthetic phantom. However, deformation observed in clinical cases is only partly explained using our generative model.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Aims: Advanced MRI modalities like functional MRI (fMRI) and MR diffusion tractography, implemented in modern neuronavigation software, are increasingly used for neurosurgery planning in children. However, mainly only a basic deterministic diffusion tensor (dDTI) tractography algorithm is used in these software packages.Aim: Evaluation of different tractography algorithms and comparison with intraoperative subcortical electrical stimulation results in a child with a brain tumor.Method: Pre-surgical fMRI and MR diffusion tractography was done in a 6 year-old child with seizures, but no motor symptoms, due to a neuroectodermal tumor in the left central region.MR diffusion acquisition was done using a b-value of 3000s/mm2 and 60 diffusion directions. Four different tractography algorithms were used: dDTI, probabilistic DTI-tracking (pDTI, FSL's Markov chain Monte carlo), deterministic and probabilistic CSD-tracking (dCSD/pCSD; constrained spherical deconvolution, Tournier et al. 2007).Results: All four tractography algorithms were able to localize the cortico-spinal tract anterior to the tumor with good agreement. More fibres could be visualized using the pDTI-and the d/pCSD-tracking algorithms than using dDTI. A proportion of the fibres traversed a solid part of the tumor, close to the internal capsule, which was best detected using pCSD and was not seen using the dDTI method. Intraoperative stimulation confirmed the visualized fibres, in particular those traversing the tumor. Consequently, only a subtotal tumor resection was performed, leaving the patient was with no sensorimotor deficit postoperatively. The spared region containing cortico-spinal tract fibres were identified in the postsurgical MRI 4 months later. Conclusion: Although all tractography algorithms successfully identified the cortico-spinal pathway, deterministic DTI-tractography, as widely used in clinical neuronavigation software, only insufficiently visualized critical fibres in this case. Further research is necessary to validate different tractography algorithms systematically.},

Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of pathogenesis triggered by abnormal connectivity. In this work we automatically created a multi-subject atlas of SWM diffusion-based bundles of the whole brain. For each subject, the complete cortico-cortical tractogram is first split into sub-tractograms connecting pairs of gyri. Then intra-subject shape-based fiber clustering performs compression of each sub-tractogram into a set of bundles. Proceeding further with shape-based clustering provides a match of the bundles across subjects. Bundles found in most of the subjects are instantiated in the atlas. To increase robustness, this procedure was performed with two independent groups of subjects, in order to discard bundles without match across the two independent atlases. Finally, the resulting intersection atlas was projected on a third independent group of subjects in order to filter out bundles without reproducible and reliable projection. The final multi-subject diffusion-based U-fiber atlas is composed of 100 bundles in total, 50 per hemisphere, from which 35 are common to both hemispheres.},

The research presented aims towards an atlas based DTI analysis of subjects with considerable brain pathologies such as tumors or hydrocephalus. In this paper, we propose a novel feature map that is robust against variations in WM fiber tract integrity and use these feature maps to determine a landmark correspondence using a 3D point correspondence algorithm. This correspondence drives a deformation field computed using Gaussian radial basis functions(RBF). This field is employed as an initialization to a standard deformable registration method like demons. We present early preliminary results on the registration of a normal control dataset to a dataset with abnormally enlarged lateral ventricles affected by fatal demyelinating Krabbe disease. The results are analyzed based on a regional tensor matching criterion and a visual assessment of overlap of major WM fiber tracts. While further evaluation and improvements are necessary, the results presented in this paper highlight the potential of our method in handling registration of subjects with severe WM pathology. © 2013 SPIE.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows researchers and clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabil-istic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The manual tract identification method required \$40 h of manual editing by a trained image analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical information that was used to manually identify the tracts included in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy-thought to be a measure of white matter integrity-in individual fiber tracts between control subjects and patients with TLE. We found that the atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those obtained with manually selected fiber tracks. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1535-1547,},

  abstract = {OBJECT Visual impairments are the most common objective manifestations of suprasellar lesions. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive MRI modality that depicts the subcortical white matter tracts in vivo. In this study the authors tested the value of visual pathway tractography in comparison with visual field and visual acuity analyses. METHODS This prospective study consisted of 25 patients with progressive visual impairment due to suprasellar mass lesions and 6 control patients with normal vision without such lesions. Visual acuity, visual field, and the optic fundus were examined preoperatively and repeated 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Visual pathway DTI tractography was performed preoperatively, intraoperatively immediately after tumor resection, and 1 week and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS In the control group, pre- and postoperative visual status were normal and visual pathway tractography revealed fibers crossing the optic chiasm without any alteration. In patients with suprasellar lesions, vision improved in 24 of 25. The mean distance between optic tracts in tractography decreased after tumor resection and detectable fibers crossing the optic chiasm increased from 12\% preoperatively to 72\% postoperatively 3 months after tumor resection, and undetectable fibers crossing the optic chiasm decreased from 88\% preoperatively to 27\% postoperatively 3 months after tumor resection. Visual improvement after tumor removal 1 week and 3 months after surgery was significantly correlated with the distance between optic tracts in intraoperative tractography (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Visual pathway DTI tractography appears to be a promising adjunct to the standard clinical and paraclinical visual examinations in patients with suprasellar mass lesions. The intraoperative findings, in particular the distance between optic tract fibers, can predict visual outcome after tumor resection. Furthermore, postoperative application of this technique may be useful in following anterior optic pathway recovery.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the location of the corticospinal tract (CST) at the corona radiata (CR). In the current study we attempted to elucidate the location of the CST for the hand at the CR using diffusion tensor tractography analysis based on functional MRI activation results. Functional MRI was performed at 1.5-T with timed hand grasp-release movements, and diffusion tensor tractography was performed using a Synergy-L Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE) head coil. Probabilistic mapping was obtained for 16 normal subjects using areas of functional MRI activation as the first region of interest (ROI 1) and the CST area in the lower pons as the second region of interest (ROI 2). The authors measured the antero-posterior and medio-lateral locations of pixels in the CST in two areas of the CR (CR 1 - the first axial image to show the septum pellucidum and the body of the fornix from the vertex, and CR 2 - the axial image showing the insular gyrus). The most probable locations in the medio-lateral direction (from the most medial point of the lateral ventricle wall to the most lateral point of the cerebral cortex) were 24.2\% in both CR 1 and 2, and the most probable locations in the antero-posterior direction (from the most anterior point of the lateral ventricle to the most posterior point of the lateral ventricle) were 66.7 and 63.6\% in CR 1 and 2, respectively. It was found that the CST for the hand descended through about one quarter (medio-lateral direction) and two-thirds (antero-posterior direction) at the CR. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {DTI is a technique that identifies white matter tracts (WMT) non-invasively in healthy and non-healthy patients using diffusion measurements. Similar to visual pathways (VP), WMT are not visible with classical MRI or intra-operatively with microscope. DIT will help neurosurgeons to prevent destruction of the VP while removing lesions adjacent to this WMT. We have performed DTI on fifty patients before and after surgery between March 2012 to January 2014. To navigate we used a 3DT1-weighted sequence. Additionally, we performed a T2-weighted and DTI-sequences. The parameters used were, FOV: 200 x 200 mm, slice thickness: 2 mm, and acquisition matrix: 96 x 96 yielding nearly isotropic voxels of 2 x 2 x 2 mm. Axial MRI was carried out using a 32 gradient direction and one b0-image. We used Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) and ASSET parallel imaging with an acceleration factor of 2 and b-value of 800 s/mm². The scanning time was less than 9 min. The DTI-data obtained were processed using a FDA approved surgical navigation system program which uses a straightforward fiber-tracking approach known as fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT). This is based on the propagation of lines between regions of interest (ROI) which is defined by a physician. A maximum angle of 50, FA start value of 0.10 and ADC stop value of 0.20 mm²/s were the parameters used for tractography. There are some limitations to this technique. The limited acquisition time frame enforces trade-offs in the image quality. Another important point not to be neglected is the brain shift during surgery. As for the latter intra-operative MRI might be helpful. Furthermore the risk of false positive or false negative tracts needs to be taken into account which might compromise the final results.},

  abstract = {We present a novel geodesic approach to segmentation of white matter tracts from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Compared to deterministic and stochastic tractography, geodesic approaches treat the geometry of the brain white matter as a manifold, often using the inverse tensor field as a Riemannian metric. The white matter pathways are then inferred from the resulting geodesics, which have the desirable property that they tend to follow the main eigenvectors of the tensors, yet still have the flexibility to deviate from these directions when it results in lower costs. While this makes such methods more robust to noise, the choice of Riemannian metric in these methods is ad hoc. A serious drawback of current geodesic methods is that geodesics tend to deviate from the major eigenvectors in high-curvature areas in order to achieve the shortest path. In this paper we propose a method for learning an adaptive Riemannian metric from the DTI data, where the resulting geodesics more closely follow the principal eigenvector of the diffusion tensors even in high-curvature regions. We also develop a way to automatically segment the white matter tracts based on the computed geodesics. We show the robustness of our method on simulated data with different noise levels. We also compare our method with tractography methods and geodesic approaches using other Riemannian metrics and demonstrate that the proposed method results in improved geodesics and segmentations using both synthetic and real DTI data. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

However, recent work has suggested that intercompartmental exchange of water between myelin and nonmyelin compartments may cause the myelin water fraction to underestimate the true myelin content of tissue. In this work, multiexponential T(2) experiments were performed in vivo within the rat spinal cord, and a wide variation of the myelin water fraction (10-35\%) was measured within four rat spinal cord tracts with similar myelin content. A numerical simulation based upon segmented histology images was used to quantitatively account for T(2) variations between tracts. The model predicts that a difference in exchange between the four spinal cord tracts, mediated by a difference in the average axon radius and myelin thickness, is sufficient to account for the variation in myelin water fraction measured in vivo.},

We quantitatively analyze the intraoperative brain deformation of 24 subjects to investigate whether simple rules can describe or predict the deformation. Interventional magnetic resonance images acquired at the start and end of the procedure are registered nonrigidly to obtain deformation values throughout the brain. Deformation patterns are investigated quantitatively with respect to the location and magnitude of deformation, and to the distribution and principal direction of the displacements. We also measure the volume change of the lateral ventricles by manual segmentation. Our study indicates that brain shift occurs predominantly in the hemisphere ipsi-lateral to the craniotomy, and that there is more brain deformation during resection procedures than during biopsy or functional procedures. However, the brain deformation patterns are extremely complex in this group of subjects. This paper quantitatively demonstrates that brain deformation occurs not only at the surface, but also in deeper brain structure, and that the principal direction of displacement does not always correspond with the direction of gravity. Therefore, simple computational algorithms that utilize limited intraoperative information (e.g., brain surface shift) will not always accurately predict brain deformation at the lesion.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare the different approaches of pre-operative diffusion-tensor-imaging-based fibre tracking (FT) of the corticospinal tract (CST) focusing on the positioning of the seeding region of interest (seed ROI). Thirty-nine patients with brain lesions in the vicinity of the CST were evaluated pre-operatively. Imaging comprised a 3D T1-weighted sequence, a gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a diffusion-weighted sequence for diffusion tensor (DT) tractography. DT tractography was performed with two different procedures to track the corticospinal fibres: one downwards and one upwards. Downward FT was started with the seed ROI in the pre-central gyrus subjacent to the maximal fMRI activity while for the upward FT seed ROI was placed in the cerebral peduncle. In 16 patients, tracking results were individually compared with the unaffected contralateral hemisphere. Results were correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) values and other factors potentially influencing fibre tracking results. On the side with the space-occupying lesion, downward FT yielded more positive tracking results (tracked fibres{$>$}0) than the upward FT. On both the affected and the unaffected side, downward FT reconstructed fewer fibres than upward FT. For none of the two methods did the tracking results (number and volume of fibres) correlate with FA values or with other clinical data. FA values for tracts ipsilateral to the lesion correlated with age and lesion entity. We conclude that the sequence of ROI positioning influences significantly the tracking results. Upward FT may fail to track fibres, whereas the successful tracking results may be superior to downward FT. Hence, upward FT of the CST should be preferred in patients with space-occupying lesions. Downward FT should be performed if upward FT fails. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

The aim was to provide a detailed and quantitative description of their terminations in 60 healthy subjects and to do so to apply an anatomical stem-based virtual dissection, mimicking classical post-mortem dissection, to extract with minimal a priori the IFOF and UF from tractography datasets. In both tracts, we consistently observed more extensive termination territories than their conventional definitions, within the middle and superior frontal, superior parietal and angular gyri for the IFOF and the middle frontal gyrus and superior, middle and inferior temporal gyri beyond the temporal pole for the UF. We revealed new insights regarding the internal organization of these tracts by investigating for the first time the frequency, distribution and hemispheric asymmetry of their terminations. Interestingly, we observed a dissociation between the lateral right-lateralized and medial left-lateralized fronto-occipital branches of the IFOF. In the UF, we observed a rightward lateralization of the orbito-frontal and temporal branches. We revealed a more detailed map of the terminations of these fiber pathways that will enable greater specificity for correlating with diseased populations and other behavioral measures. The limitations of the diffusion tensor model in this study are also discussed. We conclude that anatomical stem-based virtual dissection with diffusion tractography is a fruitful method for studying the structural anatomy of the human white matter pathways.},

  abstract = {As diffusion tractography is increasingly used to generate quantitative measures to address clinical questions, it is important to characterise the inter-session reproducibility and inter-subject variability of these measures. Here, we assess the reproducibility and variability of diffusion tractography measures using diffusion data from 8 subjects scanned 3 times. We used probabilistic tractography to define the cingulum bundle, pyramidal tracts, optic radiations and genu of the corpus callosum in each individual data set using three different methods of seed definition. Measures of mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) along the tracts were more reproducible than measures of tract volume. Further, tracts defined using a two region of interest (ROI) approach were more reproducible than those defined using manually placed seed masks alone. For mean FA taken from tracts defined using the two ROI approach, inter-session coefficients of variation (CV) were all below 5\% and inter-subject CVs were below 10\%; for mean MD inter-session, CVs were all below 3\% and inter-subject CVs were below 8\%. We use the variability measures found here to calculate the sample sizes required to detect changes in FA, MD or tract volume of a given size, either between groups of subjects or within subjects over time. Finally, we compare tractography results using 60 diffusion encoding directions to those found using a subset of 12 directions; the number of diffusion directions did not have a significant effect on reproducibility, but tracts derived using fewer directions were consistently smaller than those derived using 60 direction data. We suggest that 12 direction data are sufficient for reproducibly defining the core of large bundles but may be less sensitive to smaller pathways. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVE: To augment fiber-tracking through peritumoral regions by performing novel edema correction on clinically feasible DTI acquisitions and assess the accuracy of the fiber-tracks using intraoperative stimulation mapping (ISM), task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation maps, and postoperative follow-up as reference standards. METHODS: Edema correction, using our bi-compartment free water modeling algorithm (FERNET), was performed on clinically acquired DTI data from a cohort of 10 patients presenting with suspected high-grade glioma and peritumoral edema in proximity to and/or infiltrating language or motor pathways. Deterministic fiber-tracking was then performed on the corrected and uncorrected DTI to identify tracts pertaining to the eloquent region involved (language or motor). Tracking results were compared visually and quantitatively using mean fiber count, voxel count, and mean fiber length. The tracts through the edematous region were verified based on overlay with the corresponding motor or language task-based fMRI activation maps and intraoperative ISM points, as well as at time points after surgery when peritumoral edema had subsided. RESULTS: Volume and number of fibers increased with application of edema correction; concordantly, mean fractional anisotropy decreased. Overlay with functional activation maps and ISM-verified eloquence of the increased fibers. Comparison with postsurgical follow-up scans with lower edema further confirmed the accuracy of the tracts.},

Glioma growth is modeled via nonlinear reaction-advection-diffusion, with a two-way coupling with the underlying tissue elastic deformation. Tumor bulk and infiltration and subsequent mass-effects are not regarded separately, but captured by the model itself in the course of its evolution, Our formulation is fully Eulerian and naturally allows for updating the tumor diffusion coefficient following structural displacements caused by tumor growth/infiltration. We show that model parameters can be estimated via optimization based on imaging data, using efficient solution algorithms on regular grids. We test the model and the automatic optimization framework on real brain tumor data sets, achieving significant improvement in landmark prediction compared to a simplified purely mechanical approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for black-box and flexible simulation of soft tissue deformation for medical imaging and surgical planning applications. Our main motivation in the present work is to develop robust algorithms that allow batch processing for registration of brains with tumors to statistical atlases of normal brains and construction of brain tumor atlases. We describe a fully Eulerian formulation able to handle large deformations effortlessly, with a level-set-based approach for evolving fronts. We use a regular grid - fictitious domain method approach, in which we approximate coefficient discontinuities, distributed forces and boundary conditions. This approach circumvents the need for unstructured mesh generation, which is often a bottleneck in the modeling and simulation pipeline. Our framework employs penalty approaches to impose boundary conditions and uses a matrix-free implementation coupled with a multigrid-accelerated Krylov solver. The overall scheme results in a scalable method with minimal storage requirements and optimal algorithmic complexity. We illustrate the potential of our framework to simulate realistic brain tumor mass effects at reduced computational cost, for aiding the registration process towards the construction of brain tumor atlases. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Structural brain developmental anomalies, particularly those in frontotemporal white matter pathways, may have a genetic component and place people at increased risk for schizophrenia. The current study employed Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) as a quantitative indicator of white matter integrity. We examined twenty-two participants at high genetic risk for schizophrenia (HR), 23 people with schizophrenia (most of whom were family members of those at HR) and 37 non-psychiatric controls for comparison. In those at HR, reduced FA was observed in the cingulate and angular gyri bilaterally. In a few regions, FA was higher in HR participants than in comparison participants. These regional variations in FA might reflect differences in white matter development from comparison participants. Our data provide some evidence that abnormal white matter integrity may be detectable before the onset of a psychotic illness, although longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether these individuals at genetic risk with abnormal FA will develop illness and whether these changes are associated with the genetic risk for the disorder. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The preprocessing of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data involve numerous steps, including the corrections for head motion, susceptibility distortion, low signal-to-noise ratio, and signal drifting. Researchers or clinical practitioners often need to configure different preprocessing steps depending on disparate image acquisition schemes, which increases the technical threshold for dMRI analysis for nonexpert users. This could cause disparities in data processing approaches and thus hinder the comparability between studies. To make the dMRI data processing steps transparent and adapt to various dMRI acquisition schemes for researchers, we propose a semi-automated pipeline tool for dMRI named integrated diffusion image operator or iDIO. This pipeline integrates features from a wide range of advanced dMRI software tools and targets at providing a one-click solution for dMRI data analysis, via adaptive configuration for a set of suggested processing steps based on the image header of the input data. Additionally, the pipeline provides options for post-processing, such as estimation of diffusion tensor metrics and whole-brain tractography-based connectomes reconstruction using common brain atlases. The iDIO pipeline also outputs an easy-to-interpret quality control report to facilitate users to assess the data quality. To keep the transparency of data processing, the execution log and all the intermediate images produced in the iDIO's workflow are accessible. The goal of iDIO is to reduce the barriers for clinical or nonspecialist users to adopt the state-of-art dMRI processing steps.},

  abstract = {Human brain anatomy is extraordinarily complex, and yet, its origin is a simple tubular structure. It is characterized by dramatic structural changes during fetal development. Revealing detailed anatomy at different stages of human fetal brain development not only aids in understanding this highly ordered process but also provides clues to detect abnormalities caused by genetic or environmental factors. However, anatomical studies of human brain development during this period are surprisingly scarce, and histology-based atlases have become available only recently. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a recently developed technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is capable of noninvasively delineating macroscopic anatomical components with high contrast and revealing structures at the microscopic level. In this article, the fetal brain white matter is explored using contrasts from DTI-derived images and axonal reconstruction from DTI tractography. The highly organized structures in the cerebral layer have been revealed with primary direction of diffusion tensors. Complementary to the histology, the DTI of the fetal brain provides a valuable resource to understand the structural development of the entire brain. The resultant database will provide reference standards for diagnostic radiology of premature newborns.},

Major findings from pediatric volumetric and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity studies converge to implicate a corticolimbic network of key areas that work together to mediate the task of emotion regulation. Imaging the brain of children and adolescents with unipolar depression began with volumetric studies of isolated brain regions that served to identify key prefrontal, cingulate and limbic nodes of depression-related circuitry elucidated from more recent advances in DTI and functional connectivity imaging. Systematic review of these studies preliminarily suggests developmental differences between findings in youth and adults, including prodromal neurobiological features, along with some continuity across development.},

  abstract = {Object: As various recent studies show, damage to white matter pathways leads to permanent functional deficits in a high percentage of patients. Particularly the subcortical language network is complex, and its visualization has a tremendous relevance for neurosurgeons. This pilot study aims to correlate language-eloquent white matter pathways with the course of language function after the resection of left-sided perisylvian gliomas.Methods: We included 10 patients who underwent resection of highly language-eloquent high- (9 pts) and low-grade gliomas (1 pts). We performed navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS)-based tractography via diffusion tensor imaging fiber trackings (DTI FT) preoperatively (PRE-1), postoperatively (POST-1), and at long-term follow up or tumor recurrence (PRE-2). We separately tracked the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF), the frontal aslant tract (FAT), and the superior longitudinal (SLF), and arcuate fascicle (AF), and correlated the amount of visualized fibers to the patients' language function at each date.Results: The changes of nrTMS-based DTI FTs of single white matter pathways correlated with the according status of language function for any of the pathways in 80\% of patients and in 19 of 30 (63\%) single pathway comparisons between PRE-1 and POST-1. Between POST-1 and PRE-2 the nrTMS-based DTI FTs correlated with the status of language function for any of the pathways in all patients and in 24 of 30 (80\%) single pathway comparisons. Single FT results correlated with the according status of language function at POST-1 in 60, 70, and 60\% of cases, and with the according status of language function at PRE-2 in 60, 90, and 90\% of cases for the tracking of the IFOF, FAT, and SLF/AF, respectively.Conclusion: By the present results we were able to show that nrTMS-based DTI FT of the IFOF, FAT, and SLF/AF mainly correlates with the according status of language function preoperatively, postoperatively, and at long-term follow up after the resection of left-sided perisylvian gliomas.},

  abstract = {This article presents a method (DROID) for deformable registration of diffusion tensor (DT) images that utilizes the full tensor information by integrating the intensity and orientation features into a hierarchical matching framework. The intensity features are derived from eigen value based measures that characterize the tensor in terms of its different shape properties, such as, prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector called the geometric/intensity feature for matching. The orientation features are the orientation histograms computed from the eigenvectors. These intensity and orientation features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a deformable registration algorithm for DT images. Using orientation features improves the matching of the white matter fiber tracts by taking into account the underlying fiber orientation information. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain DT data show promising results that makes DROID potentially useful for subsequent group-based analysis of DT images to identify disease-induced and developmental changes in a population. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Early diagnosis of brain tumors plays an important role in improving treatment possibilities and increases the survival rate of the patients. Manual segmentation of the brain tumors for cancer diagnosis, from large amount of MRI images generated in clinical routine, is a difficult and time consuming task. There is a need for automatic brain tumor image segmentation. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods. Recently, automatic segmentation using deep learning methods proved popular since these methods achieve the state-of-the-art results and can address this problem better than other methods. Deep learning methods can also enable efficient processing and objective evaluation of the large amounts of MRI-based image data. There are number of existing review papers, focusing on traditional methods for MRI-based brain tumor image segmentation. Different than others, in this paper, we focus on the recent trend of deep learning methods in this field. First, an introduction to brain tumors and methods for brain tumor segmentation is given. Then, the state-of-the-art algorithms with a focus on recent trend of deep learning methods are discussed. Finally, an assessment of the current state is presented and future developments to standardize MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods into daily clinical routine are addressed.},

  abstract = {A growing literature is pointing towards the importance of white matter tracts in understanding the neural mechanisms of language processing, and determining the nature of language deficits and recovery patterns in aphasia. Measurements extracted from diffusion-weighted (DW) images provide comprehensive in~vivo measures of local microstructural properties of fiber pathways. In the current study, we compared microstructural properties of major white matter tracts implicated in language processing in each hemisphere (these included arcuate fasciculus (AF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and corpus callosum (CC), and corticospinal tract (CST) for control purposes) between individuals with aphasia and healthy controls and investigated the relationship between these neural indices and language deficits. Thirty-seven individuals with aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke and eleven age-matched controls were scanned using DW imaging sequences. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) values for each major white matter tract were extracted from DW images using tract masks chosen from standardized atlases. Individuals with aphasia were also assessed with a standardized language test in Russian targeting comprehension and production at the word and sentence level. Individuals with aphasia had significantly lower FA values for left hemisphere tracts and significantly higher values of MD, RD and AD for both left and right hemisphere tracts compared to controls, all indicating profound impairment in tract integrity. Language comprehension was predominantly related to integrity of the left IFOF and left ILF, while language production was mainly related to integrity of the left AF. In addition, individual segments of these three tracts were differentially associated with language production and comprehension in aphasia. Our findings highlight the importance of fiber pathways in supporting different language functions and point to the importance of temporal tracts in language processing, in particular, comprehension.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two statistical models have been established to evaluate characteristics associated with postoperative motor outcome in patients with glioma associated to the motor cortex (M1) or the corticospinal tract (CST). One model is based on a clinicoradiological prognostic sum score (PrS) while the other one relies on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) tractography. The objective was to compare the models regarding their prognostic value for postoperative motor outcome and extent of resection (EOR) with the aim of developing a combined, improved model. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive prospective cohort of patients who underwent resection for motor associated glioma between 2008 and 2020, and received a preoperative nTMS motor mapping with nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The primary outcomes were the EOR and the motor outcome (on the day of discharge and 3~months postoperatively according to the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) grading). For the nTMS model, the infiltration of M1, tumor-tract distance (TTD), resting motor threshold (RMT) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assesed. For the PrS score (ranging from 1 to 8, lower scores indicating a higher risk), we assessed tumor margins, volume, presence of cysts, contrast agent enhancement, MRI index (grading white matter infiltration), preoperative seizures or sensorimotor deficits. RESULTS: Two hundred and three patients with a median age of 50~years (range: 20-81~years) were analyzed of whom 145 patients (71.4\%) received a GTR. The rate of transient new motor deficits was 24.1\% and of permanent new motor deficits 18.8\%. The nTMS model demonstrated a good discrimination ability for the short-term motor outcome at day 7 of discharge (AUC~=~0.79, 95~\%CI: 0.72-0.86) and the long-term motor outcome after 3~months (AUC~=~0.79, 95~\%CI: 0.71-0.87). The PrS score was not capable to predict the postoperative motor outcome in this cohort but was moderately associated with the EOR (AUC~=~0.64; CI 0.55-0.72). An improved, combined model was calculated to predict the EOR more accurately (AUC~=~0.74, 95~\%CI: 0.65-0.83). CONCLUSION: The nTMS model was superior to the clinicoradiological PrS model for potentially predicting the motor outcome. A combined, improved model was calculated to estimate the EOR. Thus, patient counseling and surgical planning in patients with motor-associated tumors should be performed using functional nTMS data combined with tractography.},

  abstract = {Background Two statistical models have been established to evaluate characteristics associated with postoperative motor outcome in patients with glioma associated to the motor cortex (M1) or the corticospinal tract (CST). One model is based on a clinicoradiological prognostic sum score (PrS) while the other one relies on navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) tractography. The objective was to compare the models regarding their prognostic value for postoperative motor outcome and extent of resection (EOR) with the aim of developing a combined, improved model. Methods We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive prospective cohort of patients who underwent resection for motor associated glioma between 2008 and 2020, and received a preoperative nTMS motor mapping with nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging tractography. The primary outcomes were the EOR and the motor outcome (on the day of discharge and 3~months postoperatively according to the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) grading). For the nTMS model, the infiltration of M1, tumor-tract distance (TTD), resting motor threshold (RMT) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assesed. For the PrS score (ranging from 1 to 8, lower scores indicating a higher risk), we assessed tumor margins, volume, presence of cysts, contrast agent enhancement, MRI index (grading white matter infiltration), preoperative seizures or sensorimotor deficits. Results Two hundred and three patients with a median age of 50~years (range: 20–81~years) were analyzed of whom 145 patients (71.4\%) received a GTR. The rate of transient new motor deficits was 24.1\% and of permanent new motor deficits 18.8\%. The nTMS model demonstrated a good discrimination ability for the short-term motor outcome at day 7 of discharge (AUC~=~0.79, 95~\%CI: 0.72–0.86) and the long-term motor outcome after 3~months (AUC~=~0.79, 95~\%CI: 0.71–0.87). The PrS score was not capable to predict the postoperative motor outcome in this cohort but was moderately associated with the EOR (AUC~=~0.64; CI 0.55–0.72). An improved, combined model was calculated to predict the EOR more accurately (AUC~=~0.74, 95~\%CI: 0.65–0.83). Conclusion The nTMS model was superior to the clinicoradiological PrS model for potentially predicting the motor outcome. A combined, improved model was calculated to estimate the EOR. Thus, patient counseling and surgical planning in patients with motor-associated tumors should be performed using functional nTMS data combined with tractography.},

  abstract = {Predicting the displacement of cranial nerves by tumors could make surgery safer and the outcome better. Recent advances in imaging and processing have overcome some of the limits associated with cranial nerve tractography, such as spatial resolution and fiber crossing. Among others, probabilistic algorithms yield to a more accurate depiction of cranial nerve trajectories. OBJECTIVE: To report how cranial nerve probabilistic tractography can help the surgical strategy in a series of various skull base tumors. METHODS: After distortion correction and region of interest seeding, a probabilistic tractography algorithm used the constrained spherical deconvolution model and attempted the reconstruction of cranial nerve trajectories in both healthy and displaced conditions. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included and presented: vestibular schwannomas (n = 33); cerebellopontine angle meningiomas (n = 15); arachnoid or epidermoid cysts (n = 6); cavernous sinus and lower nerves schwannomas (n = 4); and other tumors (n = 4). For each patient, at least one 'displaced' cranial nerve was not clearly identified on classical anatomical MRI images. All 372 cranial nerves were successfully tracked on each healthy side; among the 175 cranial nerves considered 'displaced' by tumors, 152 (87\%) were successfully tracked. Among the 127 displaced nerves of operated patients (n = 51), their position was confirmed intraoperatively for 118 (93\%) of them. Conditions that led to tractography failure were detailed. On the basis of tractography, the surgical strategy was adjusted for 44 patients (71\%). CONCLUSION: This study reports a cranial nerve probabilistic tractography pipeline that can: predict the position of most cranial nerves displaced by skull base tumors, help the surgical strategy, and thus be a pertinent tool for future routine clinical application.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accuracy of intraoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) is crucial for its use in neurosurgical planning and its implementation in image-guided surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest prospective correlative study of the intraoperative DTI tractography of the CST and intraoperative direct electrical subcortical stimulation (DESS) of the CST, with application of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMR). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate intraoperatively acquired DTI-based tractography of the CST in correlation with DESS. METHODS: Twenty patients with gliomas (grades II-IV) adjacent to the CST were included in this prospective study. Bilateral DTI tractography of the CST was performed pre-and intraoperatively with application of 1.5-T iMRI and the results correlated and compared with the prevailing gold standard of DESS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were considered to quantify the correlation of DTI tractography with DESS. The intensity of DESS was correlated with the distance from the CST. Moreover, the tissue quality of stimulation points at the wall of the resection cavity was evaluated with 5-aminolevulinic acid. The clinical and volumetric outcomes at postoperative and follow-up periods were also analyzed. RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the patients was 54.9 ± 12 years. A total of 40 CSTs were reconstructed and 36 stimulations were included at 20 pathological CSTs, resulting in 18 true-positive, 5 false-positive, and 13 true-negative responses. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of DTI tractography to localize the CST were 100\%, 72\%, 78\%, and 100\%, respectively. DTI-based tractography correlated well at 86\% of DESSs, and a linear correlation was detected between the intensity of DESS and the distance. All of the patients improved clinically, and the mean extent of resection was 97.2\%. 5-Aminolevulinic acid was valuable in visualizing tumor infiltration in the false-positive cases, suggesting an infiltration of the CST at stimulation points. CONCLUSION: CST visualization in the iMRI setting appears to have a high sensitivity in accurately localizing the area of the CST adjacent to the resection cavity in glioma surgery. More prospective studies with a large sample size are needed to further support the results.},

  abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extent of resection is considered to be a prognostic factor in neuro-oncology. Intraoperative imaging technologies are designed to help achieve this goal. It is not clear whether any of these sometimes very expensive tools (or their combination) should be recommended as standard care for people with brain tumours. We set out to determine if intraoperative imaging technology offers any advantage in terms of extent of resection over standard surgery and if any one technology was more effective than another. OBJECTIVES: To establish the overall effectiveness and safety of intraoperative imaging technology in resection of glioma. To supplement this review of effects, we also wished to identify cost analyses and economic evaluations as part of a Brief Economic Commentary (BEC). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7, 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to June, week 4, 2017), and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 27). We searched the reference lists of all identified studies. We handsearched two journals, the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology, from 1991 to 2017, including all conference abstracts. We contacted neuro-oncologists, trial authors, and manufacturers regarding ongoing and unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating people of all ages with presumed new or recurrent glial tumours (of any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or both). Additional imaging modalities (e.g. positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were not mandatory. Interventions included intraoperative MRI (iMRI), fluorescence-guided surgery, ultrasound, and neuronavigation (with or without additional image processing, e.g. tractography). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results for relevance, undertook critical appraisal according to known guidelines, and extracted data using a prespecified pro forma. MAIN RESULTS: We identified four randomised controlled trials, using different intraoperative imaging technologies: iMRI (2 trials including 58 and 14 participants, respectively); fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (1 trial, 322 participants); and neuronavigation (1 trial, 45 participants). We identified one ongoing trial assessing iMRI with a planned sample size of 304 participants for which results are expected to be published around autumn 2018. We identified no trials for ultrasound.Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to differences in the tumours included (eloquent versus non-eloquent locations) and variations in the image guidance tools used in the control arms (usually selective utilisation of neuronavigation). There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies. All studies included people with high-grade glioma only.Extent of resection was increased in one trial of iMRI (risk ratio (RR) of incomplete resection 0.13, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.96; 1 study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence) and in the trial of 5-ALA (RR of incomplete resection 0.55, 95\% CI 0.42 to 0.71; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). The other trial assessing iMRI was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis including 14 participants, therefore the trial provides very low-quality evidence. The trial of neuronavigation provided insufficient data to evaluate the effects on extent of resection.Reporting of adverse events was incomplete and suggestive of significant reporting bias (very low-quality evidence). Overall, reported events were low in most trials. There was no clear evidence of improvement in overall survival with 5-ALA (hazard ratio 0.83, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.07; 1 study, 270 participants; low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival data were not available in an appropriate format for analysis. Data for quality of life were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias (very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative imaging technologies, specifically iMRI and 5-ALA, may be of benefit in maximising extent of resection in participants with high grade glioma. However, this is based on low to very low quality evidence, and is therefore very uncertain. The short- and long-term neurological effects are uncertain. Effects of image-guided surgery on overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life are unclear. A brief economic commentary found limited economic evidence for the equivocal use of iMRI compared with conventional surgery. In terms of costs, a non-systematic review of economic studies suggested that compared with standard surgery use of image-guided surgery has an uncertain effect on costs and that 5-aminolevulinic acid was more costly. Further research, including studies of ultrasound-guided surgery, is needed.},

  abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) tractography method has improved the ability to isolate intravoxel crossing fibers; however, the accuracy of ICA is limited in cases with voxels in local clusters lacking sufficient numbers of fibers with the same orientations. To overcome this limitation, the ICA was combined with a ball-stick model (BSM) ["ICA+BSM"]. An ICA approach is applied to identify crossing fiber components in voxels of small cluster, which are maximally independent in orientation. The eigenvectors of these components are numerically optimized via the subsequent BSM procedure. Simulation studies for two or three crossing fibers demonstrate that ICA+BSM overcomes the limitation of the original ICA method by refining regional ICA solutions in diffusion measurement of a single voxel. It shows 2°-5° of angular errors to isolate two or three fibers, providing a better recovery of simulated fibers compared with ICA alone. Human studies show that ICA+BSM achieves high anatomical correspondence of corticospinal tracts compared with postmortem corticospinal histology, yielding 92.2\% true positive detection including both lateral and medial projections, compared with 84.1\% for ICA alone. This study demonstrates that the intravoxel crossing fiber problem in clinical diffusion MRI may be sorted out more efficiently by combining ICA with BSM.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be \textasciitilde 90\% (using CSD) and 63\% (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter (WM) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF estimates.The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue ODF. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue CSD (SSST-CSD) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that MSMT-CSD can produce reliable WM/GM/CSF volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in voxels containing GM and/or CSF.

  abstract = {The ability of fiber tractography to delineate non-invasively the white matter fiber pathways of the brain raises possibilities for clinical applications and offers enormous potential for neuroscience. In the last decade, fiber tracking has become the method of choice to investigate quantitative MRI parameters in specific bundles of white matter. For neurosurgeons, it is quickly becoming an invaluable tool for the planning of surgery, allowing for visualization and localization of important white matter pathways before and even during surgery. Fiber tracking has also claimed a central role in the field of “connectomics,” a technique that builds and studies comprehensive maps of the complex network of connections within the brain, and to which significant resources have been allocated worldwide. Despite its unique abilities and exciting applications, fiber tracking is not without controversy, in particular when it comes to its interpretation. As neuroscientists are eager to study the brain's connectivity, the quantification of tractography-derived “connection strengths” between distant brain regions is becoming increasingly popular. However, this practice is often frowned upon by fiber-tracking experts. In light of this controversy, this paper provides an overview of the key concepts of tractography, the technical considerations at play, and the different types of tractography algorithm, as well as the common misconceptions and mistakes that surround them. We also highlight the ongoing challenges related to fiber tracking. While recent methodological developments have vastly increased the biological accuracy of fiber tractograms, one should be aware that, even with state-of-the-art techniques, many issues that severely bias the resulting structural “connectomes” remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel large deformation diffeomorphic registration algorithm to align high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) characterized by orientation distribution functions (ODFs). Our proposed algorithm seeks an optimal diffeomorphism of large deformation between two ODF fields in a spatial volume domain and at the same time, locally reorients an ODF in a manner such that it remains consistent with the surrounding anatomical structure. To this end, we first review the Riemannian manifold of ODFs. We then define the reorientation of an ODF when an affine transformation is applied and subsequently, define the diffeomorphic group action to be applied on the ODF based on this reorientation. We incorporate the Riemannian metric of ODFs for quantifying the similarity of two HARDI images into a variational problem defined under the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework. We finally derive the gradient of the cost function in both Riemannian spaces of diffeomorphisms and the ODFs, and present its numerical implementation. Both synthetic and real brain HARDI data are used to illustrate the performance of our registration algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.},

Three-dimensional tract reconstruction is based on the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm and a brute-force reconstruction approach. To improve the time and memory efficiency, a rapid algorithm to perform the FACT is adopted.

It is re-evaluated as a major fiber tract to link the dorsal and ventral visual stream. Although previous tractography studies showed the VOF’s cortical projections fall in the dorsal and ventral visual areas, the post-mortem dissection study for the validation remains limited. First, to validate the previous tractography data, we here performed the white matter dissection in post-mortem brains and demonstrated the VOF’s fiber bundles coursing between the V3A/B areas and the posterior fusiform gyrus. Secondly, we analyzed the VOF’s structural connectivity with diffusion tractography to link vision-associated cortical areas of the HCP MMP1.0 atlas, an updated map of the human cerebral cortex. Based on the criteria the VOF courses laterally to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and craniocaudally at the posterolateral corner of the brain, we reconstructed the VOF’s fiber tracts and found the widespread projections to the visual cortex. These findings could suggest a crucial role of VOF in integrating visual information to link the broad visual cortex as well as in connecting the dual visual stream.},

Recent findings To illustrate the potential for tractography to provide new information in clinical neuroscience we review recent studies in three broad areas: use of tractography for quantitative comparisons of specific white matter pathways in disease; evidence from tractography for the presence of qualitatively different pathways in congenital disorders or following recovery; use of tractography to gain insights into normal brain anatomy that can aid our understanding of the consequences of localised pathology, or guide interventions.

  abstract = {The optimization of acquisition parameters for precise measurement of diffusion in anisotropic systems is described. First, an algorithm is presented that minimizes the bias inherent in making measurements with a fixed set of gradient vector directions by spreading out measurements in 3-dimensional gradient vector space. Next, it is shown how the set of b-matrices and echo time can be optimized for estimating the diffusion tensor and its scalar invariants. The standard deviation in the estimate of the tensor trace in a water phantom was reduced by more than 40\% and the artefactual anisotropy was reduced by more than 60\% when using the optimized scheme compared with a more conventional scheme for the same scan time, and marked improvements are demonstrated in the human brain with the optimized sequences. Use of these optimal schemes results in reduced scan times, increased precision, or improved resolution in diffusion tensor images. Magn Reson Med 42:515-525, 1999. Precise assessment of diffusion by magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging requires a high signal-to-noise ratio for the unweighted and diffusion-weighted measurements , or requires that many measurements of signal attenuation are made. Optimal data collection schemes have been devised for isotropic media, or for estimates of diffusivity along one direction (1-7). However, with one exception involving optimization of an isotropically weighted scheme for estimation of the diffusion tensor trace (8), the problem of maximizing the precision of measurement of diffusion in anisotropic systems has not been tackled. Poor estimation of the diffusion tensor leads to imprecise mean diffusivity values, overestimates of diffusion anisotropy, and poor assessment of the direction of principal diffusivity (9-12). In this paper, previous work on the optimization of schemes to measure diffusion in isotropic media is reviewed and then developed to derive optimal schemes for measuring the diffusion tensor and its scalar invari-ants. THEORY Diffusion in Anisotropic Systems Diffusion in anisotropic systems can only be fully characterized by the symmetric 3 3 diffusion tensor matrix D: D 3 D xx D xy D xz D xy D yy D yz D xz D yz D zz 4 , [1] where D xx , D yy , and D zz relate the diffusional fluxes to the concentrations gradients in the x, y, and z directions and the off-diagonal terms reflect the correlation between diffu-sional fluxes and concentration gradients in orthogonal directions. In a diffusion-weighted spin-echo MR experiment, the signal intensity resulting from the application of diffusion-encoding gradients is S S 0 e TE/T2 e (bxxDxxbyyDyybzzDzz2bxyDxy2bxzDxz2byzDyz) , [2] where S 0 is the unweighted signal intensity, TE is the echo time, T 2 is the transverse relaxation time, and the 3 3 b-matrix is defined by: b 2 0 TE F(t) T F(t) dt. [3] is the gyromagnetic ratio constant and F is a vector of the integral of the gradient amplitudes in the x, y, and z directions, with a negation of the integral occurring at the 180° refocusing pulse, for example: F x (t) 0 t G x (t) dt 0 t TE/2 [4a] F x (t) TE/2 t},

Using DTI to assess white matter abnormalities, this study implemented a voxelwise analysis and tract-labeling strategy to test for a structural neural phenotype in autism.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects included 15 boys with autism and 8 controls, group-matched on age, cognitive functioning, sex, and handedness. DTI data were obtained by using a 3T scanner. FSL, including TBSS, was used to process and analyze DTI data where FA was chosen as the primary measure of fiber tract integrity. Affected voxels were labeled by using an integrated white matter tractography atlas. Post hoc correlation analyses were performed between FA of each affected fiber tract and scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The autism group exhibited bilateral reductions in FA involving numerous association, commissural, and projection tracts, with the most severely affected being the forceps minor. The most affected association tracts were the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus. There were no areas of increased FA in the autism group. All post hoc correlation analyses became nonsignificant after controlling for multiple comparisons.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of reduced FA along many long-range fiber tracts in autism, suggesting aberrant long-range corticocortical connectivity. Although the spatial distribution of these findings suggests widespread abnormalities, there are major differences in the degree to which different tracts are affected, suggesting a more specific neural phenotype in autism.},

In this study, we performed an in vivo investigation using tractography to assess the feasibility and reliability of mapping known connections between structures of the subcortex using the test-retest dataset from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We further validated our observations using a separate unrelated subjects dataset from the HCP. Quantitative assessment was performed by computing tract densities and spatial overlap of identified connections between subcortical ROIs. Further, known connections between structures of the basal ganglia and thalamus were identified and visually inspected, comparing tractography reconstructed trajectories with descriptions from tract-tracing studies. Our observations demonstrate both the feasibility and reliability of using a data-driven tractography-based approach to map the subcortical connectome in vivo.},

However, few studies have been focusing on the higher TP connections of the superior parietal lobule with the temporal lobe. These higher TP connections have been shown to have a role in core processes such as attention, memory, emotions, and language. Our most recent study, for the first time, hinted to the possibility of a long white matter connection interconnecting the superior parietal lobule (SPL) with the posterior temporal lobe in human brain which we call the SLF/AF TP-SPL and for a shorter abbreviation, the TP-SPL. We decided to further investigate this white matter connection using fiber assignment by continuous tracking deterministic tractography and high spatial resolution diffusion tensor imaging on 3T. Five healthy right-handed men (age range 24-37. years) were studied. We delineated the SPL connections of the SLF/AF TP bilaterally in five normal adult human brains. Using a high resolution DTT technique, we demonstrate for the first time, the trajectory of a long fiber bundle connectivity between the SPL and posterior temporal lobe, called the SLF/AF TP-SPL (or the TP-SPL), bilaterally in five healthy adult human brains. We also demonstrate the trajectory of the vertically oriented posterior TP connections, interconnecting the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) with the posterior temporal lobe (TP-IPL) in relation to the TP-SPL, arcuate fasciculus and other major language pathways. In the current study, for the first time, we categorized the TP connections into the anterior and posterior connectivity groups and subcategorized each one into the SPL or IPL connections. © 2014.},

To date, these techniques have mainly been limited to postnatal MR studies of premature infants and newborns. The primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the potential of in utero DTI and tractography to visualize the main projection and commissural pathways in 40 living, non-sedated human fetuses between 18 and 37 gestational weeks (GW) of age, with no structural brain pathologies. During a mean time of 1 min and 49 s, an axial, single-shot, echo planar DT sequence, with 32 diffusion gradient encoding directions and a reconstructed voxel size of 1.44 mm/1.45 mm/4.5 mm, was acquired. Most (90\%) of the fetuses were imaged in the cephalic presentation. In 40\% of examined fetuses, DTI measurements were robust enough to successfully calculate and visualize bilateral, craniocaudally oriented (mainly sensorimotor), and callosal trajectories in utero. Furthermore, fiber lengths, ADC, FA, and eigenvalues (λ1, λ2and λ3) were determined at different anatomically defined areas. FA values and the axial eigenvalue (λ1) showed a characteristic distribution, with the highest values for the splenium, followed by the genu, the right, and the left posterior limb of the internal capsule. The right-sided sensorimotor trajectories were found to be significantly longer than on the left side (p = 0.007), reflecting higher right-sided λ1values (14 cases vs. 9 cases). Based on the good correlation of these initial in utero tractography results with prior documented postmortem and ex utero DTI data, this new imaging technique promises new insights into the normal and pathological development of the unborn child. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent studies indicate that T1 in white matter (WM) is influenced by fiber orientation in B0 . The purpose of the study was to investigate the interrelationships between axon fiber orientation in corpus callosum (CC) and T1 relaxation time in humans in vivo as well as in rat brain ex vivo. METHODS: Volunteers were scanned for relaxometric and diffusion MRI at 3 T and 7 T. Angular T1 plots from WM were computed using fractional anisotropy and fiber-to-field-angle maps. T1 and fiber-to-field angle were measured in five sections of CC to estimate the effects of inherently varying fiber orientations on T1 within the same tracts in vivo. Ex vivo rat-brain preparation encompassing posterior CC was rotated in B0 and T1 , and diffusion MRI images acquired at 9.4 T. T1 angular plots were determined at several rotation angles in B0 . RESULTS: Angular T1 plots from global WM provided reference for estimated fiber orientation-linked T1 changes within CC. In anterior midbody of CC in vivo, where small axons are dominantly present, a shift in axon orientation is accompanied by a change in T1 , matching that estimated from WM T1 data. In CC, where large and giant axons are numerous, the measured T1 change is about 2-fold greater than the estimated one. Ex vivo rotation of the same midsagittal CC region of interest produced angular T1 plots at 9.4 T, matching those observed at 7 T in vivo. CONCLUSION: These data causally link axon fiber orientation in B0 to the T1 relaxation anisotropy in WM.},

Although the white matter tracts can be manually outlined from structural MRI this is time consuming and impractical. To enhance the spatial understanding of the distorted pathology we have established a method to retrieve this structural information automatically by registration of a standardized normal brain atlas to the individual pathologic anatomy of brain tumor patients. The skin and the brain were segmented in the patient MRI volume. Subsequently a deformable volumetric: atlas of a single normal subject was registered to the patient brain using affine and non-linear registration techniques. The estimated spatial correspondence between atlas and patient brain was used to warp the corticospinal tracts from the atlas onto the patient. The accuracy of the method was evaluated in 5 patients with extrinsic tumors of different histopathology and location by comparing selected anatomical landmark structures from the projected atlas to their manually segmented counterpart in the patient. Our method enables the visualization of complex anatomical information with minimal user interaction for routine surgical planning that would otherwise demand the acquisition of additional imaging modalities.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast and stable method for correcting the gibbs-ringing artifact. Methods: Gibbs-ringing is a well-known artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp image gradients at tissue boundaries. The origin can be seen in the truncation of k-space during MRI data-acquisition. Correction techniques like Gegenbauer reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these missing data. Here, we present a simple and robust method which exploits a different view on the Gibbs-phenomenon: The truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a convolution of the underlying image with a sinc-function. As the image is reconstructed on a discretized grid, the severity of the ringing artifacts depends on how this grid is located with respect to the edge and the oscillation pattern of the function. We propose to reinterpolate the image based on local, subvoxel-shifts to sample the ringing pattern at the zero-crossings of the oscillating sinc-function. Results: With the proposed method, the artifact can simply, effectively, and robustly be removed with a minimal amount of image smoothing. Conclusions: The robustness of the method suggests it as a suitable candidate for an implementation in the standard image processing pipeline in clinical routine.

The purpose of this investigation was to study these structures in the anterior temporal lobe and the external and extreme capsules and to correlate the dissected anatomy with the cross-sectional MR anatomy. METHODS: Progressive dissection was guided by three-dimensional MR renderings and cross-sectional images. Dissected segments of the tracts and the temporal stem were traced and projected onto reformatted images. The method of dissection tractography is detailed in a companion article. RESULTS: The temporal stem extends posteriorly from the level of the amygdala to the level of the lateral geniculate body. The uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi pass from the temporal lobe into the extreme and external capsules via the temporal stem. Meyer’s loop extends to the level of the amygdala, adjacent to the uncinate fasciculus and anterior commissure. These anatomic features were demonstrated on correlative cross-sectional MR images and compared with clinical examples. CONCLUSION: This study clarified the MR anatomy of the uncinate and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculi and Meyer’s loop in the temporal stem and in the external and extreme capsules, helping to explain patterns of tumor spread. The inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus is an important yet previously neglected tract. These results provide a solid anatomic foundation for diffusion tractography of the normal temporal stem and its tracts, as well as their abnormalities in brain disorders such as epilepsy, postoperative complications, trauma, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer disease.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

  abstract = {Purpose: Intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is a powerful modality for acquiring images of the brain to facilitate precise image-guided neurosurgery. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) provides critical information about location, orientation and structure of nerve fibre tracts, but suffers from the “susceptibility artefact” stemming from magnetic field perturbations due to the step change in magnetic susceptibility at air–tissue boundaries in the head. An existing approach to correcting the artefact is to acquire a field map by means of an additional MRI scan. However, to recover true field maps from the acquired field maps near air–tissue boundaries is challenging, and acquired field maps are unavailable in historical MRI data sets. This paper reports a detailed account of our method to simulate field maps from structural MRI scans that was first presented at IPCAI 2014 and provides a thorough experimental and analysis section to quantitatively validate our technique. Methods: We perform automatic air–tissue segmentation of intraoperative MRI scans, feed the segmentation into a field map simulation step and apply the acquired and the simulated field maps to correct DW-MRI data sets. Results: We report results for 12 patient data sets acquired during anterior temporal lobe resection surgery for the surgical management of focal epilepsy. We find a close agreement between acquired and simulated field maps and observe a statistically significant reduction in the susceptibility artefact in DW-MRI data sets corrected using simulated field maps in the vicinity of the resection. The artefact reduction obtained using acquired field maps remains better than that using the simulated field maps in all evaluated regions of the brain. Conclusions: The proposed simulated field maps facilitate susceptibility artefact reduction near the resection. Accurate air–tissue segmentation is key to achieving accurate simulation. The proposed simulation approach is adaptable to different iMRI and neurosurgical applications.},

  abstract = {Reconstruction of neuronal fibers using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is an emerging method in biomedical research. Existing fiber-tracking algorithms are commonly based on the "walker principle." Fibers are reconstructed as trajectories of "walkers," which are guided according to local diffusion properties. In this study, a new method of fiber tracking is proposed that does not engage any "walking" algorithm. It resolves a number of inherent problems of the "walking" approach, in particular the reconstruction of crossing and spreading fibers. In the proposed method, the fibers are built with small line elements. Each line element contributes an anisotropic term to the simulated DW signal, which is adjusted to the measured signal. This method demonstrates good results for simulated fibers. A single in vivo result demonstrates the successful reconstruction of the dominant neuronal pathways. A comparison with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber assignment with continuous tracking (FACT) method and the probabilistic index of connectivity (PICo) method based on a multitensor model is performed for the callosal fibers. The result shows a strong increase in the number of reconstructed fibers. These almost fill the total white matter (WM) volume and connect a large area of the cortex. The method is very computationally expensive. Possible ways to address this problem are discussed. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but novel methods now make it possible to address them by examining the relationship between common genetic variability and brain endophenotype. We addressed the hypothesis that variability in the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) pathway would be related to brain development. We employed machine learning in an unsupervised, unbiased, combined analysis of whole-brain diffusion tractography together with genomewide, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genotypes from a cohort of 272 preterm infants, using Sparse Reduced Rank Regression (sRRR) and correcting for ethnicity and age at birth and imaging. Empirical selection frequencies for SNPs associated with cerebral connectivity ranged from 0.663 to zero, with multiple highly selected SNPs mapping to genes forPPARG(six SNPs),ITGA6(four SNPs), andFXR1(two SNPs). SNPs inPPARGwere significantly overrepresented (ranked 7-11 and 67 of 556,000 SNPs;P{$<$} 2.2 × 10-7), and were mostly in introns or regulatory regions with predicted effects including protein coding and nonsense-mediated decay. Edge-centric graph-theoretic analysis showed that highly selected white-matter tracts were consistent across the group and important for information transfer (P{$<$} 2.2 × 10-17); they most often connected to the insula (P{$<$} 6 × 10-17). These results suggest that the inhibited brain development seen in humans exposed to the stress of a premature extrauterine environment is modulated by genetic factors, and that PPARG signaling has a previously unrecognized role in cerebral development.},

Most of the studies included descriptive statistics of patient populations of mixed pathology, and iMRI systems of varying field strengths between 0·15 and 1·5 Tesla. Most studies provided information on EOTR, but did not always mention how iMRI affected the surgical strategy. Only a few studies included information on quality of life or survival for subpopulations with glioblastoma multiforme or high-grade glioma. Several limitations and sources of bias were apparent, which affected the conclusions drawn and might have led to overestimation of the added value of iMRI-guided surgery for resection of glioblastoma multiforme. Based on the available literature, there is, at best, level 2 evidence that iMRI-guided surgery is more effective than conventional neuronavigation-guided surgery in increasing EOTR, enhancing quality of life, or prolonging survival after resection of glioblastoma multiforme. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have questioned the traditional belief that the corticospinal tract (CST) arises exclusively from the precentral gyrus and passes through the anterior half of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) in humans; however, no direct evidence existed from structural imaging, and developmental aspects of CST origin have not been clarified. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to test the hypotheses that CST can originate from both pre- and postcentral gyri and is located posteriorly in the PLIC, and we also determined how age, sex, or handedness affected these locations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two healthy children (2.6-17.5 years of age; 20 girls) underwent DTI. Subsequently, tractography was performed on the basis of fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm and brute force approach, with a fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold of {$<$}0.2 and an angle threshold of {$>$}50°. The CST was isolated by using a knowledge-based region-of-interest approach, and its cortical origin and location on the PLIC was determined. RESULTS: DTI revealed that the CST originated from both pre- and postcentral gyri in 71.4\% of hemispheres, from the precentral gyrus only in 19\%, and from the postcentral gyrus only in 7.1\%. The overall distribution was similar in both hemispheres. However, children with CST originating from both pre- and postcentral gyri were older (mean, 11.1 years of age) than those with precentral origin (mean, 5.8 years of age) or postcentral origin (mean, 7.8 years of age) only (P = .00003). The center of the CST was localized at 65\% of the length (from its anterior margin) of the PLIC, and the CST occupied 26.5\% of its anteroposterior length. There was a significant positive correlation between age and FA of the CST (r = 0.49; P = .002). The volume of the precentral portion of the left CST was significantly higher than that of its postcentral portion (P = .01) and that of the right CST (P = .0002). The pattern of cortical origin of CST, its location at the level of PLIC, and its volume and FA were unaffected by sex or handedness. CONCLUSIONS: The CST most frequently originates from both pre- and postcentral gyri, especially in older children, and is typically centered approximately two thirds of the distance from the anterior margin of the PLIC and occupies about a quarter of its anteroposterior length. In young children, the CST can often be seen originating exclusively from the precentral gyrus by DTI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an appreciable overlap in the clinical presentation, epidemiology and treatment response of the two major psychotic disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, the shared neurobiological correlates of these two disorders are still elusive. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we sought to identify brain regions which share altered white-matter connectivity across a clinical spectrum of psychotic disorders.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHOD: A sample of 41 healthy controls, 62 patients in a clinically stable state of an established psychotic disorder (40 with schizophrenia, 22 with bipolar disorder) were studied using DTI. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used in order to study group differences between patients with psychosis and healthy controls using fractional anisotropy (FA). Probabilistic tractography was used in order to visualize the clusters that showed significant differences between these two groups.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The TBSS analysis revealed five clusters (callosal, posterior thalamic/optic, paralimbic, fronto-occipital) with reduced FA in psychosis.

  abstract = {Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies and computational modelling suggests an organization of language in a dual dorsal–ventral brain network: a dorsal stream connects temporoparietal with frontal premotor regions through the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculus and integrates sensorimotor processing, e.g. in repetition of speech. A ventral stream connects temporal and prefrontal regions via the extreme capsule and mediates meaning, e.g. in auditory comprehension. The aim of our study was to test, in a large sample of 100 aphasic stroke patients, how well acute impairments of repetition and comprehension correlate with lesions of either the dorsal or ventral stream. We combined voxelwise lesion-behaviour mapping with the dorsal and ventral white matter fibre tracts determined by probabilistic fibre tracking in our previous study in healthy subjects. We found that repetition impairments were mainly associated with lesions located in the posterior temporoparietal region with a statistical lesion maximum in the periventricular white matter in projection of the dorsal superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, lesions associated with comprehension deficits were found more ventral-anterior in the temporoprefrontal region with a statistical lesion maximum between the insular cortex and the putamen in projection of the ventral extreme capsule. Individual lesion overlap with the dorsal fibre tract showed a significant negative correlation with repetition performance, whereas lesion overlap with the ventral fibre tract revealed a significant negative correlation with comprehension performance. To summarize, our results from patients with acute stroke lesions support the claim that language is organized along two segregated dorsal–ventral streams. Particularly, this is the first lesion study demonstrating that task performance on auditory comprehension measures requires an interaction between temporal and prefrontal brain regions via the ventral extreme capsule pathway.},

Whilst in adults tractography has been used to demonstrate that damage to the optic radiations leads to postoperative visual field deficits, this approach has yet to be properly explored in children. Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography in characterizing microstructural changes in children with epilepsy pre-and post-surgery affecting the occipital, parietal or temporal lobes. Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging and the Spherical Mean Technique were used to investigate the microstructure of the optic radiations. Furthermore, tractography was used to evaluate whether pre-surgical reconstructions of the optic radiations overlap with the resection margin as measured using anatomical post-surgical T1-weighted MRI.},

These form discrete, functionally specialized, territories with topographically arranged graduated patterns of connectivity. However, previous in vivo thalamic parcellation with MRI has been hindered by substantial inter-individual variability or discrepancies between MRI derived segmentations and histological sections. Here, we use the Euclidean distance to characterize probabilistic tractography distributions derived from diffusion MRI. We generate 12 feature maps by performing voxel-wise parameterization of the distance histograms (6 feature maps) and the distribution of three-dimensional distance transition gradients generated by applying a Sobel kernel to the distance metrics. We use these 12 feature maps to delineate individual thalamic nuclei, then extract the tractography profiles for each and calculate the voxel-wise tractography gradients. Within each thalamic nucleus, the tractography gradients were topographically arranged as distinct non-overlapping cortical networks with transitory overlapping mid-zones. This work significantly advances quantitative segmentation of the thalamus in vivo using 3T MRI. At an individual subject level, the thalamic segmentations consistently achieve a close relationship with a priori histological atlas information, and resolve in vivo topographic gradients within each thalamic nucleus for the first time. Additionally, these techniques allow individual thalamic nuclei to be closely aligned across large populations and generate measures of inter-individual variability that can be used to study both basic function and pathological processes in vivo.},

This registration technique however has a high computational cost as spherical harmonics need to be calculated for every normal. By binning the normals, the computational efficiency is improved as the spherical harmonics can be pre-computed and cached at each bin location. In this paper we evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the equiangle grid, icosahedron subdivision and the Fibonacci spiral, an approach we propose. It is found that the equiangle grid has the best efficiency as it can perform direct binning, followed by the Fibonacci spiral and then the icosahedron, all of which decrease the computational cost compared to no binning. The Fibonacci spiral produces the highest achieved accuracy of the three approaches while maintaining a low number of bins. The number of bins allowed by the equiangle grid and icosahedron are much more restrictive than the Fibonacci spiral. The performed analysis shows that the Fibonacci spiral can perform as well as the original cross-correlation algorithm without binning, while also providing a significant improvement in computational efficiency.},

Numerous studies have been published that attempt to identify or reconstruct particular pathways of interest. An atlas or map of all the pathways in the white matter would be particularly useful for providing detailed anatomical data that is not available in studies based on conventional MRI data. In this paper we present a method for constructing a white matter atlas to define structures from diffusion tensor tractography by making use of the locations of the anatomical terminations of individual streamlines that pass through white matter. We show how a map of unique seed regions can be used to generate tracts of interest. This approach provides anatomical information that can be rapidly applied to MRI datasets for the clear identification of white matter tracts. We show close correspondence of the tracts generated from the atlas with tracts isolated with classical dissection of post-mortem brain tissue. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Throughout infancy, childhood, and adolescence, our brains undergo remarkable changes. Processes including myelination and synaptogenesis occur rapidly across the first 2–3 years of life, and ongoing brain remodeling continues into young adulthood. Studies have sought to characterize the patterns of structural brain development, and early studies predominately relied upon gross anatomical measures of brain structure, morphology, and organization. MRI offers the ability to characterize and quantify a range of microstructural aspects of brain tissue that may be more closely related to fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. Techniques such as diffusion, magnetization transfer, relaxometry, and myelin water imaging provide insight into changing cyto- and myeloarchitecture, neuronal density, and structural connectivity. In this review, we focus on the growing body of literature exploiting these MRI techniques to better understand the microstructural changes that occur in brain white matter during maturation. Our review focuses on studies of normative brain development from birth to early adulthood (∼25 years), and places particular emphasis on longitudinal studies and newer techniques that are being used to study microstructural white matter development. All imaging methods demonstrate consistent, rapid microstructural white matter development over the first 3 years of life, suggesting increased myelination and axonal packing. Diffusion studies clearly demonstrate continued white matter maturation during later childhood and adolescence, though the lack of consistent findings in other modalities suggests changes may be mainly due to axonal packing. An emerging literature details differential microstructural development in boys and girls, and connects developmental trajectories to cognitive abilities, behaviour, and/or environmental factors, though the nature of these relationships remains unclear. Future research will need to focus on newer imaging techniques and longitudinal studies to provide more detailed information about microstructural white matter development, particularly in the childhood years.},

  abstract = {Understanding typical, healthy brain development provides a baseline from which to detect and characterize brain anomalies associated with various neurological or psychiatric disorders and diseases. Diffusion MRI is well suited to study white matter development, as it can virtually extract individual tracts and yield parameters that may reflect alterations in the underlying neural micro-structure (e.g. myelination, axon density, fiber coherence), though it is limited by its lack of specificity and other methodological concerns. This review summarizes the last decade of diffusion imaging studies of healthy white matter development spanning childhood to early adulthood (4–35~years). Conclusions about anatomical location, rates, and timing of white matter development with age are discussed, as well as the influence of image acquisition, analysis, age range/sample size, and statistical model. Despite methodological variability between studies, some consistent findings have emerged from the literature. Specifically, diffusion studies of neurodevelopment overwhelmingly demonstrate regionally varying increases of fractional anisotropy and decreases of mean diffusivity during childhood and adolescence, some of which continue into adulthood. While most studies use linear fits to model age-related changes, studies with sufficient sample sizes and age range provide clear evidence that white matter development (as indicated by diffusion) is non-linear. Several studies further suggest that maturation in association tracts with frontal-temporal connections continues later than commissural and projection tracts. The emerging contributions of more advanced diffusion methods are also discussed, as they may reveal new aspects of white matter development. Although non-specific, diffusion changes may reflect increases of myelination, axonal packing, and/or coherence with age that may be associated with changes in cognition.},

Results were assessed in relation to water compartmentation in biologic tissues (restricted diffsuion) and tissue perfusion.

As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols.

In this paper, we describe a novel autoencoder-based learning method to filter streamlines from diffusion MRI tractography, and hence, to obtain more reliable tractograms. Our method, dubbed FINTA (Filtering in Tractography using Autoencoders) uses raw, unlabeled tractograms to train the autoencoder, and to learn a robust representation of brain streamlines. Such an embedding is then used to filter undesired streamline samples using a nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experiments on both synthetic and in vivo human brain diffusion MRI tractography data obtain accuracy scores exceeding the 90\% threshold on the test set. Results reveal that FINTA has a superior filtering performance compared to conventional, anatomy-based methods, and the RecoBundles state-of-the-art method. Additionally, we demonstrate that FINTA can be applied to partial tractograms without requiring changes to the framework. We also show that the proposed method generalizes well across different tracking methods and datasets, and shortens significantly the computation time for large ({$>$}1 M streamlines) tractograms. Together, this work brings forward a new deep learning framework in tractography based on autoencoders, which offers a flexible and powerful method for white matter filtering and bundling that could enhance tractometry and connectivity analyses.},

  abstract = {Current tractography methods use the local orientation information to propagate streamlines from seed locations. Many such seeds provide streamlines that stop prematurely or fail to map the true white matter pathways because some bundles are “harder-to-track” than others. This results in tractography reconstructions with poor white and gray matter spatial coverage. In this work, we propose a generative, autoencoder-based method, named GESTA (Generative Sampling in Bundle Tractography using Autoencoders), that produces streamlines achieving better spatial coverage. Compared to other deep learning methods, our autoencoder-based framework uses a single model to generate streamlines in a bundle-wise fashion, and does not require to propagate local orientations. GESTA produces new and complete streamlines for any given white matter bundle, including hard-to-track bundles. Applied on top of a given tractogram, GESTA is shown to be effective in improving the white matter volume coverage in poorly populated bundles, both on synthetic and human brain in vivo data. Our streamline evaluation framework ensures that the streamlines produced by GESTA are anatomically plausible and fit well to the local diffusion signal. The streamline evaluation criteria assess anatomy (white matter coverage), local orientation alignment (direction), and geometry features of streamlines, and optionally, gray matter connectivity. The GESTA framework offers considerable gains in bundle overlap using a reduced set of seeding streamlines with a 1.5x improvement for the “Fiber Cup”, and 6x for the ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge datasets. Similarly, it provides a 4x white matter volume increase on the BIL\&GIN callosal homotopic dataset, and successfully populates bundles on the multi-subject, multi-site, whole-brain in vivo TractoInferno dataset. GESTA is thus a novel deep generative bundle tractography method that can be used to improve the tractography reconstruction of the white matter.},

  abstract = {Ependymomas are generally considered to be noninfiltrative tumors that have discrete borders with adjacent brain tissue. Most occur in the posterior fossa or spinal cord. Supratentorial ependymal tumors arise near the ventricular system or, more rarely, within the cerebral white matter or cortex. Presented here are 6 supratentorial ependymal tumors, 3 that primarily involve the cerebral cortex and 3 that extend into the cortex from the underlying white matter. By microscopy, all of these tumors locally infiltrate the cortex and/or white matter along small blood vessels and axonal fiber tracts. They also form other glioma secondary structures including perineuronal tumor cell satellitosis and subpial tumor cell mounds. The 3 cortical ependymal tumors show a spectrum of features ranging from conventional and clear-cell ependymoma-like patterns to more angiocentric glioma-like histology. Because ependymal tumors generally have a significantly better prognosis than other infiltrating gliomas, recognition of their capacity to infiltrate adjacent cortex and white matter is important to prevent the misdiagnosis of oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, or infiltrating glioma, not otherwise specified. Cortical ependymomas and angiocentric gliomas may comprise a group of locally infiltrative ependymal tumors that are associated with an excellent prognosis after gross total surgical resection. © 2008 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.},

Scientific discoveries must replicate under a specific set of conditions; to translate to the clinic we must show that findings using purpose-built scientific instruments will be observable in clinical populations and instruments. Here we describe and evaluate data and computational methods designed to translate a scientific observation to a clinical setting. Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), Wahl et al. (2010) observed that across subjects the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) of homologous pairs of tracts is highly correlated. We hypothesize that this is a fundamental biological trait that should be present in most healthy participants, and deviations from this assessment may be a useful diagnostic metric. Using this metric as an illustration of our methods, we analyzed six pairs of homologous white matter tracts in nine different DWI datasets with 44 subjects each. Considering the original FA measurement as a baseline, we show that the new metric is between 2 and 4 times more precise when used in a clinical context. Our framework to translate research findings into clinical practice can be applied, in principle, to other neuroimaging results.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study addressed the benefit of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) compared with conventional neuronavigation-guided resection in patients with gliomas. Research design and methods: The Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched up to 26 September 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two-arm prospective studies, and retrospective studies in patients with glioblastoma/glioma who had received surgical treatment were included. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measures were the extent of tumor resection and tumor size reduction for using iMRI-guided or conventional neuronavigation-guided neurosurgery. Secondary outcomes included impact of surgery on 6 month progression-free survival (PFS), 12 month overall survival (OS) rates and surgical duration. Results: We found that iMRI was associated with greater rate of gross total resection (rGTR) compared with conventional neuronavigation procedures (3.16, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.07–4.83, P {$<$}.001). We found no difference between the two neuronavigation approaches in extent of resection (EOR), tumor size reduction, or time required for surgery (P values ≥.065). Intraoperative MRI was associated with a higher rate of progression-free survival (PFS) compared with conventional neuronavigation (odds ratio, 1.84; 95\% CI 1.15–2.95; P =.012), but the rate of overall survival (OS) between groups was similar (P =.799). Limitations of the study included the fact that data from non-RCTs was used, the small study population, and heterogeneity of outcomes across studies. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that iMRI more frequently resulted in more complete resections leading to improved PFS in patients with malignant gliomas.},

As a consequence, there is a large interest in the automatic segmentation of white matter tract in diffusion tensor MRI data. Methods based on the tractography are popular for white matter tract segmentation. However, because of the limited consistency and long processing time, such methods may not be suitable for clinical practice. We therefore developed a novel convolutional neural network based method to directly segment white matter tract trained on a low-resolution dataset of 9149 DTI images. The method is optimized on input, loss function and network architecture selections. We evaluated both segmentation accuracy and reproducibility, and reproducibility of determining tract-specific diffusion measures. The reproducibility of the method is higher than that of the reference standard and the determined diffusion measures are consistent. Therefore, we expect our method to be applicable in clinical practice and in longitudinal analysis of white matter microstructure.},

  abstract = {Subtle changes in white matter (WM) microstructure have been associated with normal aging and neurodegeneration. To study these associations in more detail, it is highly important that the WM tracts can be accurately and reproducibly characterized from brain diffusion MRI. In addition, to enable analysis of WM tracts in large datasets and in clinical practice it is essential to have methodology that is fast and easy to apply. This work therefore presents a new approach for WM tract segmentation: Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct extraction of WM tracts from diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural network (CNN). This 3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in aging individuals from a large population-based study (N \hspace{0pt}= \hspace{0pt}9752, 1.5T MRI). The proposed method showed good segmentation performance and high reproducibility, i.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, κ=0.72−0.83) and a low scan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy: ε=1\%−5\%). The reproducibility of the proposed method was higher than that of a tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being orders of magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed that the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an external dementia dataset (N \hspace{0pt}= \hspace{0pt}58, 3T MRI). In two proof-of-principle experiments, we associated WM microstructure obtained using the proposed method with age in a normal elderly population, and with disease subtypes in a dementia cohort. In concordance with the literature, results showed a widespread reduction of microstructural organization with aging and substantial group-wise microstructure differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we presented a highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that has the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI is a useful neuroimaging tool for non-invasive mapping of human brain microstructure and structural connections. The analysis of diffusion MRI data often requires brain segmentation, including volumetric segmentation and cerebral cortical surfaces, from additional high-resolution T1-weighted (T1w) anatomical MRI data, which may be unacquired or corrupted by subject motion or hardware failure or cannot be accurately co-registered to the diffusion data that are not corrected for susceptibility-induced geometric distortion. To address these challenges, this study proposes to synthesize high-quality T1w anatomical images directly from diffusion data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (entitled “DeepAnat”), including a U-Net and a hybrid generative adversarial network (GAN), and perform brain segmentation on synthesized T1w images or co-register synthesized and native T1w images. The quantitative and systematic evaluation using data of 60 young subjects provided by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) shows that the synthesized T1w images and results for brain segmentation and comprehensive diffusion analysis tasks are highly similar to those from native T1w images. The brain segmentation accuracy is slightly higher for the U-Net than the GAN. The efficacy of DeepAnat is further validated on a larger dataset of 300 more elderly subjects provided by the UK Biobank. Moreover, the U-Nets trained and validated on the HCP and UK Biobank data are shown to be highly generalizable to the diffusion data from Massachusetts General Hospital Connectome Diffusion Microstructure Dataset (MGH CDMD) acquired with different hardware systems and imaging protocols and therefore can be used directly without retraining or with fine-tuning for further improved performance. Finally, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the alignment between native T1w images and diffusion images uncorrected for geometric distortion assisted by synthesized T1w images substantially improves upon that by co-registering the diffusion and T1w images directly using the data of 20 subjects from MGH CDMD. In summary, our study demonstrates the benefits and practical feasibility of DeepAnat for assisting various diffusion MRI data analyses and supports its use in neuroscientific applications.},

  abstract = {The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is a complex associative tract comprising three distinct subdivisions in the frontoparietal cortex, each of which has its own anatomical connectivity and functional roles. However, many studies on white matter development, hampered by limitations of data quality and tractography methods, treated the SLF as a single entity. The exact anatomical trajectory and developmental status of each sub-bundle of the human SLF in neonates remain poorly understood. Here, we compared the morphological and microstructural characteristics of each branch of the SLF at two ages using diffusion MRI data from 40 healthy neonates and 40 adults. A multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (MSMT-CSD) algorithm was used to ensure the successful separation of the three SLF branches (SLF I, SLF II and SLF III). Then, between-group differences in the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) metrics were investigated in all the SLF branches. Meanwhile, Mahalanobis distances based on all the diffusion metrics were computed to quantify the maturation of neonatal SLF branches, considering the adult brain as the reference. The SLF branches, excluding SLF II, had similar fibre morphology and connectivity between the neonatal and adult groups. The Mahalanobis distance values further supported the notion of heterogeneous maturation among SLF branches. The greatest Mahalanobis distance was observed in SLF II, possibly indicating that it was the least mature. Our findings provide a new anatomical basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by abnormal neonatal SLF development.},

Although it has been successfully used to reconstruct large white matter tracts in the human and animal brains, the sensitivity and specificity of dMRI tractography remained limited. In particular, the fiber orientation distributions (FODs) estimated from dMRI signals, key to tractography, may deviate from histologically measured fiber orientation in crossing fibers and gray matter regions. In this study, we demonstrated that a deep learning network, trained using mesoscopic tract-tracing data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, was able to improve the estimation of FODs from mouse brain dMRI data. Tractography results based on the network generated FODs showed improved specificity while maintaining sensitivity comparable to results based on FOD estimated using a conventional spherical deconvolution method. Our result is a proof-of-concept of how mesoscale tract-tracing data can guide dMRI tractography and enhance our ability to characterize brain connectivity.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor tractography of the anterior extent of the optic radiation - Meyer's loop - prior to temporal lobe resection (TLR) may reduce the risk for postoperative visual field defect. Currently there is no standardized way to perform tractography. Objective: To visualize Meyer's loop using deterministic (DTG) and probabilistic tractography (PTG) at different probability levels, with the primary aim to explore possible differences between methods, and the secondary aim to explore anatomical accuracy. Methods: Twenty-three diffusion tensor imaging exams (11 controls and 7 TLR-patients, pre- and post-surgical) were analyzed using DTG and PTG thresholded at probability levels 0.2\%, 0.5\%, 1\%, 5\% and 10\%. The distance from the tip of the temporal lobe to the anterior limit of Meyer's loop (TP-ML) was measured in 46 optic radiations. Differences in TP-ML between the methods were compared. Results of the control group were compared to dissection studies and to a histological atlas. Results: For controls and patients together, there were statistically significant differences (p{$<$} 0.01) for TP-ML between all methods thresholded at PTG ≤1\% compared to all methods thresholded at PTG 5\% and DTG. There were no statistically significant differences between PTG 0.2\%, 0.5\% and 1\% or between PTG 5\%, 10\% and DTG. For the control group, PTG ≤1\% showed a closer match to dissection studies and PTG 1\% showed the best match to histological tracings of Meyer's loop. Conclusions: Choice of tractography method affected the visualized location of Meyer's loop significantly in a heterogeneous, clinically relevant study group. For the controls, PTG at probability levels ≤1\% was a closer match to dissection studies. To determine the anterior extent of Meyer's loop, PTG is superior to DTG and the probability level of PTG matters. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical feasibility of using probabilistic diffusion tractography based on constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) to image the optic radiation. It was hypothesized that CSD would provide improved tracking of the OR compared with the widely used ball-and-stick model. Methods: Diffusion weighted MRI (30 directions) was performed on twenty patients with no known visual deficits. Tractography was performed using probabilistic algorithms based on fiber orientation distribution models of local white matter trajectories. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated by comparing computational times and receiver operating characteristic results, and by correlation of anatomical landmark distances to dissection estimates. Results: The results showed that it was consistently feasible to reconstruct individual optic radiations from clinically practical (4.5 minute acquisition) diffusion weighted imaging data sets using CSD. Tractography based on the CSD model resulted in significantly shorter computational times, improved receiver operating characteristic results, and shorter Meyer's loop to temporal pole distances (in closer agreement with dissection studies) when compared to the ball-and-stick based algorithm. Conclusions: Accurate tractography of the optic radiation can be accomplished using diffusion MRI data collected within a clinically practical timeframe. CSD based tractography was faster, more accurate and had better correlation with known anatomical landmarks than ball-andstick tractography.},

Yet, the spatiotemporal patterns of microstructural changes along these tracts, as well as the developmental interaction between the white matter (WM) tracts and the cortical gray matter (cGM) connected to them, are mostly unknown during infancy. In this study, we performed a diffusion MRI-based tractography and microstructure study in a cohort of 89 healthy preterm-born infants with gestational age at birth between 28.1∼36.4 weeks and postmenstrual age at scan between 39.9∼59.9 weeks. Results revealed that several C-shaped fibers, such as the arcuate fasciculus, cingulum, and uncinate fasciculus, demonstrated symmetrical along-tract profiles; and the horizontally oriented running fibers, including the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, demonstrated an anterior-posterior developmental gradient. This study characterized the along-tract profiles using fixel-based analysis and revealed that the fiber cross-section (FC) of all five association fibers demonstrated a fluctuating increase with age, while the fiber density (FD) monotonically increase with age. NODDI was utilized to analyze the microstructural development of cGM and indicated cGM connected to the anterior end of the association fibers developed faster than that of the posterior end during 0–5 months. Notably, a mediation analysis was used to explore the relation between the development of WM and associated cGM, and demonstrated a partial mediation effect of FD in WM on the development of intracellular volume (ICV) in cGM and a full mediation effect of ICV on the growth of FD in most fibers, suggesting a predominant mediation of cGM on the WM development. Furthermore, for assessing whether those results were biased by prematurity, we compared preterm- and term-born neonates with matched scan age, gender, and multiple births from the developing human connectome project (dHCP) dataset to assess the effect of preterm-birth, and the results indicated a similar developmental pattern of the association fibers and their attached cGM. These findings presented a comprehensive picture of the major association fibers during early infancy and deciphered the developmental interaction between WM and cGM in this period.},

  abstract = {Background: Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) has been recognized as a useful adjunct for brain tumor surgery in pediatric patients. There is minimal data on the use of an offsite intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging operating theater (iMRI OT), whereby vehicle transfer of patients is involved. The primary aim of this study is to validate the feasibility of perioperative patient transfer to use an offsite iMRI OT for patients with pediatric brain tumor. Secondary objectives include the assessment of tumor resection efficacy and perioperative outcomes in our patient cohort. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-institution clinical study of prospectively collected data from Singapore's largest children hospital. Variables of interest include issues encountered during interhospital transfer, achievement of surgical aims, length of stay in hospital, and postoperative complications. Our findings were compared with results of related studies published in the literature. Results: From January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018, a total of 35 pediatric operative cases were performed in our offsite iMRI OT. Within this cohort, 24 of these were brain tumor surgery cases. For all the patients in this study, use of the iMRI OT influenced intraoperative decisions. Average ambulance transport time from parent hospital to the iMRI OT was 30.5 minutes, and from iMRI OT back to the parent hospital after surgery was 27.7 minutes. The average length of hospitalization stay was 7.9 days per patient. There were no ferromagnetic accidents during perioperative iMRI scanning and no airway/hemodynamic incidents in patients encountered during interhospital transfer. Conclusions: In our local context, the use of interhospital transfers for access to iMRI OT is a safe and feasible option in ensuring good patient outcomes for a select group of patients with pediatric brain tumors.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the influence of sex and brain size on compartmental brain volumes (grey matter, white matter, CSF) in a large and well-matched sample of neurologically normal women (n = 50) and men (n = 50). As expected, we found a significant sex difference for the absolute volumes of total brain, grey matter, white matter and CSF, with greater volumes for men. Relating these compartmental volume measures to brain volume resulting in proportional volume measures revealed a higher proportion of grey matter in women. No significant sex differences were found for white matter and CSF proportions. However, when the influence of sex was partialized out by regression analyses, brain volume explained 40-81\% of the variance of the absolute grey matter, white matter and CSF volumes. Performing these regression analyses for the proportional volume measures revealed that brain volume explained ∼ 16\% of the variance in grey matter proportion. Sex or the interaction between sex and brain volume revealed no additional predicitve values. Interestingly, the correlation between brain volume and grey matter proportion was negative, with larger brains exhibiting relatively smaller proportions of grey matter. Thus, sex is not the main variable explaining the variability in grey matter volume. Rather, we suggest that brain size is the main variable determining the proportion of grey matter. © 2002 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

  abstract = {, "Retrospective study comparing model-based deformation correction to intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging for image-guided neurosurgery," Abstract. Brain shift during tumor resection compromises the spatial validity of registered preoperative imaging data that is critical to image-guided procedures. One current clinical solution to mitigate the effects is to reimage using intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. Although iMR has demonstrated benefits in accounting for preoperative-to-intraoperative tissue changes, its cost and encumbrance have limited its widespread adoption. While iMR will likely continue to be employed for challenging cases, a cost-effective model-based brain shift compensation strategy is desirable as a complementary technology for standard resections. We performed a retrospective study of n ¼ 9 tumor resection cases, comparing iMR measurements with intraoperative brain shift compensation predicted by our model-based strategy, driven by sparse intraoperative cortical surface data. For quantitative assessment, homologous subsurface targets near the tumors were selected on preoperative MR and iMR images. Once rigidly registered, intraoperative shift measurements were determined and subsequently compared to model-predicted counterparts as estimated by the brain shift correction framework. When considering moderate and high shift ({$>$}3 mm, n ¼ 13 AE 6 measurements per case), the alignment error due to brain shift reduced from 5.7 AE 2.6 to 2.3 AE 1.1 mm, representing ∼59\% correction. These first steps toward validation are promising for model-based strategies.},

  abstract = {© 2019 SPIE. Brai\#resn shift during neurosurgery can compromise the fidelity of image guidance and potentially lead to surgical error. We have developed a finite element model-based brain shift compensation strategy to correct preoperative images for improved intraoperative navigation. This workflow-friendly approach precomputes potential intraoperative deformations (a â€ deformation atlas') via a biphasic-biomechanical-model accounting for brain deformation associated with cerebrospinal fluid drainage, osmotic agents, resection, and swelling. Intraoperatively, an inverse problem approach is employed to provide a combinatory fit from the atlas that best matches sparse intraoperative measurements. Subsequently, preoperative image is deformed accordingly to better reflect patient's intraoperative anatomy. While we have performed several retrospective studies examining model's accuracy using post-or intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging, one challenging task is to examine model's ability to recapture shift due to the aforementioned effects independently with clinical data and in a longitudinal manner under varying conditions. The work here is a case study where swelling was observed at the initial stage of surgery (after craniotomy and dura opening), subsequently sag was observed in a later stage of resection. Intraoperative tissue swelling and sag were captured via an optically tracked stylus by identifying cortical surface vessel features (n = 9), and model-based correction was performed for these two distinct types of brain shift at different stages of the procedure. Within the course of the entire surgery, we estimate the cortical surface experienced a deformation trajectory absolute path length of approximately 19.4 ± 2.1 mm reflecting swelling followed by sag. Overall, model reduced swelling-induced shift from 7.3 ± 1.1 to 1.8 ± 0.5 mm (∼74.6\% correction); for subsequent sag movement, model reduced shift from 6.4 ± 1.5 to 1.4 ± 0.5 mm (∼76.6\% correction).},

  abstract = {Intraoperative tissue deformation, known as brain shift, decreases the benefit of using preoperative images to guide neurosurgery. Non-rigid registration of preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) to intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) has been proposed as a means to compensate for brain shift. We focus on the initial registration from MR to predurotomy iUS. We present a method that builds on previous work to address the need for accuracy and generality of MR-iUS registration algorithms in multi-site clinical data. High-dimensional texture attributes were used instead of image intensities for image registration and the standard difference-based attribute matching was replaced with correlation-based attribute matching. A strategy that deals explicitly with the large field-of-view mismatch between MR and iUS images was proposed. Key parameters were optimized across independent MR-iUS brain tumor datasets acquired at 3 institutions, with a total of 43 tumor patients and 758 reference landmarks for evaluating the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Despite differences in imaging protocols, patient demographics and landmark distributions, the algorithm is able to reduce landmark errors prior to registration in three data sets (5.37±4.27, 4.18±1.97 and 6.18±3.38 mm, respectively) to a consistently low level (2.28±0.71, 2.08±0.37 and 2.24±0.78 mm, respectively). This algorithm was tested against 15 other algorithms and it is competitive with the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. We show that the algorithm has one of the lowest errors in all datasets (accuracy), and this is achieved while sticking to a fixed set of parameters for multi-site data (generality). In contrast, other algorithms/tools of similar performance need per-dataset parameter tuning (high accuracy but lower generality), and those that stick to fixed parameters have larger errors or inconsistent performance (generality but not the top accuracy). Landmark errors were further characterized according to brain regions and tumor types, a topic so far missing in the literature.},

Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90\% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations.},

  abstract = {Objective Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus (ANT) has been shown to be a safe and efficacious treatment option for patients with Drug-Resitant focal Epilepsy (DRE). The ANT has been selected frequently in open and controlled studies for bilateral DBS. There is a substantial variability in ANT-DBS outcomes which is not fully understood. These outcomes might not be explained by the target location alone but potentially depend on the connectivity of the mere stimulation site with the epilepsy onset-associated brain regions. The likely sub-components of this anatomy are fiber pathways which penetrate or touch the ANT region and constitute a complex and dense fiber network which has not been described so far. A detailed characterization of this ANT associated fiber anatomy may therefore help to identify which areas are associated with positive or negative outcomes of ANT-DBS. Furthermore, prediction properties in individual ANT-DBS cases might be tested. In this work we aim to generate an anatomically detailed map of candidate fiber structures which might in the future lead to a holistic image of structural connectivity of the ANT region. Methods To resolve the various components of the complex fiber network connected to the ANT we used a synthetic pathway reconstruction method that combines anatomical fiber tracking with dMRI-based tractography and iteratively created an anatomical high-resolution fiber map representing the most important bundles related to the ANT. Results The anatomically detailed 3D representation of the fibers in the ANT region generated with the synthetic pathway reconstruction method incorporates multiple anatomically defined fiber bundles with their course, orientation, connectivity and relative strength. Distinctive positions within the ANT region have a different hierarchical profile with respect to the stimulation-activated fiber bundles. This detailed connectivity map, which is embedded into the topographic map of the MNI brain, provides novel opportunities to analyze the outcomes of the ANT-DBS studies. Conclusion Our synthetic reconstruction method provides the first anatomically realistic fiber pathway map in the human ANT region incorporating histological and structural MRI data. We propose that this complex ANT fiber network can be used for detailed analysis of the outcomes of DBS studies and potentially for visualization during the stimulation planning procedures. The connectivity map might also facilitate surgical planning and will help to simulate the complex ANT connectivity. Possible activation patterns that may be elicited by electrodes in different positions in the ANT region will help to understand clinically diverse outcomes based on this new dense fiber network map. As a consequence this work might in the future help to improve individual outcomes in ANT-DBS.},

However, DTI is not a routine procedure for preoperative planning for brain tumor resection. Our study aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of DTI and the outcomes of surgery.

Studies were systematically reviewed based on the application of DTI in pre-surgical planning, modification of operative planning, re-evaluation of preoperative DTI data intraoperatively, and the outcome of surgery decisions. Seventeen studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies agreed that preoperative planning using DTI improves postoperative neuro-deficits, giving a greater resection yield and shortening the surgery time. The results also indicate that the re-evaluation of preoperative DTI intraoperatively assists in a better visualization of white matter tract shifts. Seven studies also suggested that DTI modified the surgical decision of the initial surgical approach and the rate of the GTR in tumor resection surgery. The utilization of DTI may give essential information on white matter tract pathways, for a better surgical approach, and eventually reduce the risk of neurologic deficits after surgery.},

At this, the data term is modelled on the basis of the population density of cancerous cells obtained from the solution of an initial boundary value problem. A soft constraint allows for approximating bio-mechanical properties of brain tissue. It is demonstrated that introducing a non-linear weighting functional with respect to the computed density of cancerous cells into both - the data term and the soft constraint - allows for an adaptive control of the deformation pattern. Additionally, we explicitly penalise deformations of rigid structures and extend the numerical scheme by exploiting analytical derivatives as well as the compact support of the employed parametric deformation model during optimisation.

  abstract = {Objectives: In the present paper a novel computational framework for modeling tumor induced brain deformation as a biophysical prior for non-rigid image registration is described. More precisely, we aim at providing a generic building block for non-rigid image registration that can be used to resolve inherent irregularities in non-diffeomorphic registration problems that naturally arise in serial and cross-population brain tumor imaging studies due to the presence (or progression) of pathology. Methods: The model for the description of brain cancer dynamics on a tissue level is based on an initial boundary value problem (IBVP). The IBVP follows the accepted assumption that the progression of primary brain tumors on a tissue level is governed by proliferation and migration of cancerous cells into surrounding healthy tissue. The model of tumor induced brain deformation is phrased as a parametric, constrained optimization problem. As a basis of comparison and to demonstrate generalizability additional soft constraints (penalties) are considered. A backtracking line search is implemented in conjunction with a limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS) method in order to handle the numerically delicate log barrier strategy for confining volume change. Results: Numerical experiments are per -formed to test the flexible control of the computed deformation patterns in terms of varying model parameters. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively related to patterns in patient individual magnetic resonance imaging data. Conclusions: Numerical experiments demonstrate the flexible control of the computed deformation patterns. This in turn strongly suggests that the model can be adapted to patient individual imaging patterns of brain tumors. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of the computed cancer profiles to patterns in medical imaging data of an exemplary patient demonstrates plausibility. The designed optimization problem is based on computational tools widely used in non-rigid image registration, which in turn makes the model generally applicable for integration into non-rigid image registration algorithms. © Schattauer 2012.},

Integrative analysis of CNS tumors, including clinically acquired multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and the inverse problem of calibrating biophysical models to mpMRI data, assists in identifying macroscopic quantifiable tumor patterns of invasion and proliferation, potentially leading to improved (a) detection/segmentation of tumor subregions and (b) computer-aided diagnostic/prognostic/predictive modeling. This article presents a summary of (a) biophysical growth modeling and simulation,(b) inverse problems for model calibration, (c) these models' integration with imaging workflows, and (d) their application to clinically relevant studies. We anticipate that such quantitative integrative analysis may even be beneficial in a future revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for CNS tumors, ultimately improving patient survival prospects.},

  abstract = {Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging, or DWI, is one of the most promising tools for the analysis of neural microstructure and the structural connectome of the human brain. The application of DWI to map early development of the human connectome in-utero, however, is challenged by intermittent fetal and maternal motion that disrupts the spatial correspondence of data acquired in the relatively long DWI acquisitions. Fetuses move continuously during DWI scans. Reliable and accurate analysis of the fetal brain structural connectome requires careful compensation of motion effects and robust reconstruction to avoid introducing bias based on the degree of fetal motion. In this paper we introduce a novel robust algorithm to reconstruct in-vivo diffusion-tensor MRI (DTI) of the moving fetal brain and show its effect on structural connectivity analysis. The proposed algorithm involves multiple steps of image registration incorporating a dynamic registration-based motion tracking algorithm to restore the spatial correspondence of DWI data at the slice level and reconstruct DTI of the fetal brain in the standard (atlas) coordinate space. A weighted linear least squares approach is adapted to remove the effect of intra-slice motion and reconstruct DTI from motion-corrected data. The proposed algorithm was tested on data obtained from 21 healthy fetuses scanned in-utero at 22–38 weeks gestation. Significantly higher fractional anisotropy values in fiber-rich regions, and the analysis of whole-brain tractography and group structural connectivity, showed the efficacy of the proposed method compared to the analyses based on original data and previously proposed methods. The results of this study show that slice-level motion correction and robust reconstruction is necessary for reliable in-vivo structural connectivity analysis of the fetal brain. Connectivity analysis based on graph theoretic measures show high degree of modularity and clustering, and short average characteristic path lengths indicative of small-worldness property of the fetal brain network. These findings comply with previous findings in newborns and a recent study on fetuses. The proposed algorithm can provide valuable information from DWI of the fetal brain not available in the assessment of the original 2D slices and may be used to more reliably study the developing fetal brain connectome.},

Here, in the lights of these new functional data, we dissected 14 post-mortem human hemispheres using the Klingler fiber dissection technique, to study the IFOF fibers and to identify their actual cortical terminations in the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. We identified two different components of the IFOF: (i) a superficial and dorsal subcomponent, which connects the frontal lobe with the superior parietal lobe and the posterior portion of the superior and middle occipital gyri, (ii) a deep and ventral subcomponent, which connects the frontal lobe with the posterior portion of the inferior occipital gyrus and the posterior temporo-basal area. Thus, our results are in line with the hypothesis of the functional role of the IFOF in the semantic system, by showing that it is mainly connected with two areas involved in semantics: the occipital associative extrastriate cortex and the temporo-basal region. Further combined anatomical (dissection and Diffusion Tensor Imaging) and functional (intraoperative subcortical stimulation) studies are needed, to clarify the exact participation of each IFOF subcomponent in semantic processing.},

Objective: To analyze the subcortical anatomy of a specific region within the parietal and temporal lobes where 7 long-distances tracts intersect, ie, the temporoparietal fiber intersection area (TPFIA). Methods: Four postmortem human hemispheres were dissected, and 4 healthy hemispheres were analyzed through the use of diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography software. The different tracts that intersect at the posterior temporal and parietal lobes were isolated, and the relations with the surrounding structures were analyzed. Results: Seven tracts pass through the TPFIA: horizontal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, middle longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, optic radiations, and tapetum. The TPFIA was located deep to the angular gyrus, posterior portion of the supramarginal gyrus, and posterior portion of the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. Conclusion: The TPFIA is a critical neural crossroad; it is traversed by 7 white matter tracts that connect multiple areas of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere. It is also a vulnerable part of the network in that a lesion within this area will produce multiple disconnections.

However, little is known about the exact cortical terminations of this tract. The aim of the present work is to isolate the different subcomponents of this tract with fiber dissection and DTI tractography, and to identify the exact cortical connections. Twelve postmortem human hemispheres (6 right and 6 left) were dissected using the cortex-sparing fiber dissection. In addition, three healthy brains were analyzed using DTI-based tractography software. The different components of the perisylvian SLF were isolated and the fibers were followed until the cortical terminations. Three segments of the perisylvian SLF were identified: (1) anterior segment, connecting the supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus with the precentral gyrus, (2) posterior segment, connecting the posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus with the angular gyrus, and (3) long segment of the arcuate fasciculus that connects the middle and inferior temporal gyri with the precentral gyrus and posterior portion of the inferior and middle frontal gyri. In the present study, three different components of the perisylvian SLF were identified. For the first time, our dissections revealed that each component was connected to a specific cortical area within the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. By accurately depicting not only the trajectory but also cortical connections of this bundle, it is possible to develop new insights into the putative functional role of this tract. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Today more than 100 intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units have been installed in hospitals worldwide. Intraoperative MRI is an important tool for brain tumor surgery, because it compensates for brain shift, allows accurate navigation, and provides information about the tumor remnant. This information enables neurosurgeons to perform real-time image-guided surgery. Currently, the MRI technique is used not only for imaging but also in monitoring of intracranial physiological factors such as cerebrospinal fluid flow and brain tissue temperature. This article discusses planning for installation of intraoperative MRI, the advantages of low and high field magnets, MRI safety for intraoperative procedures, and the use of intraoperative imaging for brain tumor surgery. Additionally, we describe prospective uses of intraoperative MRI, such as focused ultrasound system to deliver ablation to various intracranial lesions and an opening in the blood brain barrier.},

Methods: Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 25) or bipolar disorder (n = 40) were recruited from families with two or more affected members and age-matched to a control group (n = 49). All participants underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging that was subsequently analyzed with probabilistic tractography. Mean FA was calculated bilaterally for the uncinate and anterior thalamic radiation and compared between groups with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder showed common reductions in the uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation. These reductions were unrelated to age, duration of illness, current medication, or current psychiatric symptoms in all patients or the lifetime presence of psychotic symptoms in bipolar subjects. Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder show common abnormalities in the uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation that fail to respect traditional diagnostic boundaries.

  abstract = {Background An accurate delineation of the optic radiation (OR) using diffusion MR tractography may reduce the risk of a visual field deficit after temporal lobe resection. However, tractography is prone to generate spurious streamlines, which deviate strongly from neighboring streamlines and hinder a reliable distance measurement between the temporal pole and the Meyer's loop (ML-TP distance). New method Stability metrics are introduced for the automated removal of spurious streamlines near the Meyer's loop. Firstly, fiber-to-bundle coherence (FBC) measures can identify spurious streamlines by estimating their alignment with the surrounding streamline bundle. Secondly, robust threshold selection removes spurious streamlines while preventing an underestimation of the extent of the Meyer's loop. Standardized parameter selection is realized through test–retest evaluation of the variability in ML-TP distance. Results The variability in ML-TP distance after parameter selection was below 2 mm for each of the healthy volunteers studied (N = 8). The importance of the stability metrics is illustrated for epilepsy surgery candidates (N = 3) for whom the damage to the Meyer's loop was evaluated by comparing the pre- and post-operative OR reconstruction. The difference between predicted and observed damage is in the order of a few millimeters, which is the error in measured ML-TP distance. Comparison with existing method(s) The stability metrics are a novel method for the robust estimate of the ML-TP distance. Conclusions The stability metrics are a promising tool for clinical trial studies, in which the damage to the OR can be related to the visual field deficit that may occur after epilepsy surgery.},

FA reduction, however, is non-specific for microscopic underpinnings such as aberrant myelination or fiber density (FD). Using recent advances in DWI, we tested the hypothesis of reduced FD in premature-born adults and investigated its link with the degree of prematurity and cognition. 73 premature- and 89 mature-born adults aged 25–27\&nbsp;years underwent single-shell DWI, from which a FD measure was derived using convex optimization modeling for microstructure informed tractography (COMMIT). Premature-born adults exhibited lower FD in numerous tracts including the corpus callosum and corona radiata compared to mature-born adults. These FD alterations were associated with both the degree of prematurity, as assessed via gestational age and birth weight, as well as with reduced cognition as measured by full-scale IQ. Finally, lower FD overlapped with lower FA, suggesting lower FD underlie unspecific FA reductions. Results provide evidence that premature birth leads to lower FD in adulthood which links with lower full-scale IQ. Data suggest that lower FD partly underpins FA reductions of premature birth but that other processes such as hypomyelination might also take place.},

Its assumed role is in visual processing and spatial awareness. To date, anatomical and neuroimaging studies on human and animal brains are not in agreement about the existence, course, and terminations of SFOF. To clarify the existence of the SFOF in human brains, we applied deterministic fiber tractography to a template of 488 healthy subjects and to 80 individual subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and validated the results with white matter microdissection of post-mortem human brains. The imaging results showed that previous reconstructions of the SFOF were generated by two false continuations, namely between superior thalamic peduncle (STP) and stria terminalis (ST), and ST and posterior thalamic peduncle. The anatomical microdissection confirmed this finding. No other fiber tracts in the previously described location of the SFOF were identified. Hence, our data suggest that the SFOF does not exist in the human brain. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4964–4971, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging provides information about the location of white matter tracts within the human brain. For neurosurgery, this imaging technique is of major interest in order to minimize the risk of postoperative neurological deficits. In preoperative planning, fiber tracking algorithms based on streamline propagation are used in order to reconstruct major fiber tracts. The resulting streamline bundles approximate the course of the underlying white matter structures and indicate their shape and location in 3 dimensions as well as the spatial relation with respect to surrounding anatomy. However, for intraoperative application in combination with the neuronavigation system, these streamline representations are not adequate. Hulls encompassing the streamline bundles are necessary, since the boundary curves of hulls can be superimposed on the operating room (OR) microscope view for guidance in neurosurgery. METHODS: In this work, we present a novel hull approach which is based on rasterization and isosurface extraction, combined with surface filtering techniques. The advantages of this approach are its robustness and the possibility to control the tightness of wrapping. RESULTS: The approach makes it possible to generate precise hulls for different tract systems, which can be used as a basis for intraoperative visualization in the OR microscope. Distance measurements further confirm the accuracy of the hulls.},

  abstract = {The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is a cortical area contributing to a multiplicity of visual, language-related, and cognitive functions. In line with this functional richness, also the organization of the underlying white matter is highly complex and includes several bundles. The few studies tackling the outcome and neurological burdens of surgical operations addressing TPJ document the presence of language disturbances and visual field damages, with the latter hardly recovered in time. This observation advocates for identifying and functionally monitoring the optic radiation (OR) bundles that cross the white matter below the TPJ. In the present study, we adopted a multimodal approach to address the anatomo-functional correlates of the OR’s dorsal loop. In particular, we combined cadavers’ dissection with tractographic and electrophysiological data collected in drug-resistant epileptic patients explored by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Cadaver dissection allowed us to appreciate the course and topography of the dorsal loop. More surprisingly, both tractographic and electrophysiological observations converged on a unitary picture highly coherent with the data obtained by neuroanatomical observation. The combination of diverse and multimodal observations allows overcoming the limitations intrinsic to single methodologies, defining a unitary picture which makes it possible to investigate the dorsal loop both presurgically and at the individual patient level, ultimately contributing to limit the postsurgical damages. Notwithstanding, such a combined approach could serve as a model of investigation for future neuroanatomical inquiries tackling white matter fibers anatomy and function through SEEG-derived neurophysiological data.},

  abstract = {Most neuroimaging studies of brain function analyze data in normalized space to identify regions of common activation across participants. These studies treat interindividual differences in brain organization as noise, but this approach can obscure important information about the brain's functional architecture. Recently, a number of studies have adopted a person-specific approach that aims to characterize these individual differences and explore their reliability and implications for behavior. A subset of these studies has taken a precision imaging approach that collects multiple hours of data from each participant to map brain function on a finer scale. In this review, we provide a broad overview of how person-specific and precision imaging techniques have used resting-state measures to examine individual differences in the brain's organization and their impact on behavior, followed by how task-based activity continues to add detail to these discoveries. We argue that person-specific and precision approaches demonstrate substantial promise in uncovering new details of the brain's functional organization and its relationship to behavior in many areas of cognitive neuroscience. We also discuss some current limitations in this new field and some new directions it may take.},

In addition to established use in surgical and medical training, VR/AR are gaining traction for clinical use preoperatively and intraoperatively. To understand the utility of VR/AR in the clinical setting, we conducted a literature search in Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE with various search terms designed to capture the use of VR/AR in neurosurgical procedures for resection of cranial tumors. The search retrieved 302 articles, of which 35 were subjected to full-text review; 19 full-text articles were included in the review. Key findings highlighted by the individual authors were extracted and summarized into themes to present the value of VR/AR in the clinical setting. These studies included various VR/AR systems applied to surgeries involving heterogeneous pathologies and outcome measures. Overall, VR/AR were found to be qualitatively advantageous due to enhanced visualization of complex anatomy and improved intraoperative lesion localization. When these technologies were compared with existing neuronavigation systems, quantitative clinical benefits were also reported. The capacity to visualize three-dimensional images superimposed on patient anatomy is a potentially valuable tool in complex neurosurgical environments. Surgical limitations may be addressed through future advances in image registration and tracking as well as intraoperatively acquired imaging with the ability to yield real-time virtual models.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography offer the unique possibility to visualize the developing white matter macroanatomy of the human fetal brain in vivo and in utero and are currently under investigation for their potential use in the diagnosis of developmental pathologies of the human central nervous system. However, in order to establish in utero DTI as a clinical imaging tool, an independent comparison between macroscopic imaging and microscopic histology data in the same subject is needed. The present study aimed to cross-validate normal as well as abnormal in utero tractography results of commissural and internal capsule fibers in human fetal brains using postmortem histological structure tensor (ST) analysis. In utero tractography findings from two structurally unremarkable and five abnormal fetal brains were compared to the results of postmortem ST analysis applied to digitalized whole hemisphere sections of the same subjects. An approach to perform ST-based deterministic tractography in histological sections was implemented to overcome limitations in correlating in utero tractography to postmortem histology data. ST analysis and histology-based tractography of fetal brain sections enabled the direct assessment of the anisotropic organization and main fiber orientation of fetal telencephalic layers on a micro- and macroscopic scale, and validated in utero tractography results of corpus callosum and internal capsule fiber tracts. Cross-validation of abnormal in utero tractography results could be achieved in four subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and in two cases with malformations of internal capsule fibers. In addition, potential limitations of current DTI-based in utero tractography could be demonstrated in several brain regions. Combining the three-dimensional nature of DTI-based in utero tractography with the microscopic resolution provided by histological ST analysis may ultimately facilitate a more complete morphologic characterization of axon guidance disorders at prenatal stages of human brain development.},

  abstract = {An approach to the deformable registration of three-dimensional brain tumor images to a normal brain atlas is presented. The approach involves the integration of three components: a biomechanical model of tumor mass-effect, a statistical approach to estimate the model's parameters, and a deformable image registration method. Statistical properties of the sought deformation map from the atlas to the image of a tumor patient are first obtained through tumor mass-effect simulations on normal brain images. This map is decomposed into the sum of two components in orthogonal subspaces, one representing inter-individual differences in brain shape, and the other representing tumor-induced deformation. For a new tumor case, a partial observation of the sought deformation map is obtained via deformable image registration and is decomposed into the aforementioned spaces in order to estimate the mass-effect model parameters. Using this estimate, a simulation of tumor mass-effect is performed on the atlas image in order to generate an image that is similar to tumor patient's image, thereby facilitating the atlas registration process. Results for a real tumor case and a number of simulated tumor cases indicate significant reduction in the registration error due to the presented approach as compared to the direct use of deformable image registration. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This relatively new technique has generated much enthusiasm and high expectations because it presently is the only approach available to non-invasively study the three-dimensional architecture of white matter tracts. While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations. In this review we therefore assess the basic principles and the assumptions that need to be made for each step of the study, including both data acquisition and the elaborate fiber reconstruction algorithms. Special attention is paid to situations where complications may arise, and possible solutions are reviewed. Validation issues and potential future directions and improvements are also discussed.

In this study the authors investigated peritumoral edema by performing lambda chart analysis (LCA), a noninvasive technique that can be used to make visible and analyze apparent water diffusivity in tissues in vivo, and assessed the utility of LCA in differentiating high-grade gliomas from nonglial tumors. Methods. The water diffusivity characteristics of peritumoral edema associated with four tumor groups - 12 high-grade gliomas, five low-grade gliomas, 11 metastatic tumors, and 15 meningiomas - were assessed in 43 patients by performing magnetic resonance imaging with the aid of a 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. In all tumor groups, peritumoral edema exhibited greater trace values and reduced anisotropy compared with normal white matter. Edema associated with high-grade gliomas had significantly higher trace values than edema associated with the other three tumor groups, although the anisotropic angles of those groups were comparable. Conclusions. Lambda chart analysis identified two distinct types of peritumoral edema: edema associated with high-grade gliomas and edema associated with low-grade gliomas or nonglial tumors. The apparent water diffusivity was significantly greater in high-grade gliomas, whereas the anisotropy in these lesions was comparable to that of edema in other tumors. These findings indicated that water movement in areas of edema, predominantly in the extracellular spaces, was less restricted in high-grade gliomas, a phenomenon that likely reflected the destruction of the extracellular matrix ultrastructure by malignant cell infiltration and consequently greater water diffusion. Although preliminary, this study indicates that LCA could be used as a clinical tool for differentiating high-grade gliomas and for evaluating the extent of cellular infiltration.},

  abstract = {Purpose: White-matter tract segmentation in patients with brain pathology can guide surgical planning and can be used for tissue integrity assessment. Recently, TractSeg was proposed for automatic tract segmentation in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to assess the use of TractSeg for corticospinal-tract (CST) segmentation in a large cohort of patients with brain pathology and to evaluate its consistency in repeated measurements. Methods: A total of 649 diffusion-tensor-imaging scans were included, of them: 625 patients and 24 scans from 12 healthy controls (scanned twice for consistency assessment). Manual CST labeling was performed in all cases, and by 2 raters for the healthy subjects. Segmentation results were evaluated based on the Dice score. In order to evaluate consistency in repeated measurements, volume, Fractional Anisotropy (FA), and Mean Diffusivity (MD) values were extracted and correlated for the manual versus automatic methods. Results: For the automatic CST segmentation Dice scores of 0.63 and 0.64 for the training and testing datasets were obtained. Higher consistency between measurements was detected for the automatic segmentation, with between measurements correlations of volume\,=\,0.92/0.65, MD\,=\,0.94/0.75 for the automatic versus manual segmentation. Conclusions: The TractSeg method enables automatic CST segmentation in patients with brain pathology. Superior measurements consistency was detected for the automatic in comparison to manual fiber segmentation, which indicates an advantage when using this method for clinical and longitudinal studies.},

  abstract = {T he ideal treatment strategy for both lower-grade and high-grade gliomas has recently been reported to be maximal tumor resection as the initial therapeutic option. 11,16,24 A large number of studies based on objective evaluation of the extent of resection (EOR) in cases of gliomas showed that a total resection, or maximum EOR, significantly increased not only the progression-free survival but also the overall survival (OS). 3,11,15,24,26,29 Regarding lower-grade gliomas in particular, one evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommends resection over observation to improve OS for patients, a recommendation based on high levels of evidence. 1 However, these infiltra-tive gliomas are often observed near or within eloquent regions of the brain, 8,25 which means that their removal increases the risk of neurological damage, including motor, language, and cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, the gold-ABBREVIATIONS EOR = extent of resection; iMRI = intraoperative MRI; OS = overall survival. OBJECTIVE Maximum extent of resection (EOR) for lower-grade and high-grade gliomas can increase survival rates of patients. However, these infiltrative gliomas are often observed near or within eloquent regions of the brain. Awake surgery is of known benefit for the treatment of gliomas associated with eloquent regions in that brain function can be preserved. On the other hand, intraoperative MRI (iMRI) has been successfully used to maximize the resection of tumors, which can detect small amounts of residual tumors. Therefore, the authors assessed the value of combining awake craniotomy and iMRI for the resection of brain tumors in eloquent areas of the brain. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 33 consecutive patients with glial tumors in the eloquent brain areas who underwent awake surgery using iMRI. Volumetric analysis of MRI studies was performed. The pre-, intra-, and postoperative tumor volumes were measured in all cases using MRI studies obtained before, during, and after tumor resection. RESULTS Intraoperative MRI was performed to check for the presence of residual tumor during awake surgery in a total of 25 patients. Initial iMRI confirmed no further tumor resection in 9 patients (36\%) because all observable tumors had already been removed. In contrast, intraoperative confirmation of residual tumor during awake surgery led to further tumor resection in 16 cases (64\%) and eventually an EOR of more than 90\% in 8 of 16 cases (50\%). Furthermore, EOR benefiting from iMRI by more than 15\% was found in 7 of 16 cases (43.8\%). Interestingly, the increase in EOR as a result of iMRI for tumors associated mainly with the insular lobe was significantly greater, at 15.1\%, than it was for the other tumors, which was 8.0\% (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that combining awake surgery with iMRI was associated with a favorable surgical outcome for intrinsic brain tumors associated with eloquent areas. In particular, these benefits were noted for patients with tumors with complex anatomy, such as those associated with the insular lobe. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2016.9.JNS16152},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Robust preoperative imaging can improve the extent of resection in patients with brain tumors while minimizing postoperative neurological morbidity. Both structural and functional imaging techniques can provide helpful preoperative information. A recent study found that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) tractography has significant predictive value for permanent deficits. The present study directly compares the predictive value of TMS tractography and task-based functional MRI (fMRI) tractography in the same cohort of glioma patients.                                         METHODS               Clinical outcome data were collected from charts of patients with motor eloquent glioma and preoperative fMRI and TMS studies. The primary outcome was a new or worsened motor deficit present at the 3-month postoperative follow-up, which was termed a "permanent deficit." Postoperative MR images were overlaid onto preoperative plans to determine which imaging features were resected. Multiple fractional anisotropic thresholds (FATs) were screened for both TMS and fMRI tractography. The predictive value of the various thresholds was modeled using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.                                         RESULTS               Forty patients were included in this study. Six patients (15\%) sustained permanent postoperative motor deficits. A significantly greater predictive value was found for TMS tractography than for fMRI tractography regardless of the FAT. Despite 35\% of patients showing clinically relevant neuroplasticity captured by TMS, only 2.5\% of patients showed a blood oxygen level–dependent signal displaced from the precentral gyrus. Comparing the best-performing FAT for both modalities, TMS seeded tractography showed superior predictive value across all metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.                                         CONCLUSIONS               The results from this study indicate that the prediction of permanent deficits with TMS tractography is superior to that with fMRI tractography, possibly because TMS tractography captures clinically relevant neuroplasticity. However, future large-scale prospective studies are needed to fully illuminate the proper role of each modality in comprehensive presurgical workups for patients with motor-eloquent tumors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tractography is a popular tool for visualizing the corticospinal tract (CST). However, results may be influenced by numerous variables, eg, the selection of seeding regions of interests (ROIs) or the chosen tracking algorithm. OBJECTIVE: To compare different variable sets by correlating tractography results with intraoperative subcortical stimulation of the CST, correcting intraoperative brain shift by the use of intraoperative MRI. METHODS: Seeding ROIs were created by means of motor cortex segmentation, functional MRI (fMRI), and navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Based on these ROIs, tractography was run for each patient using a deterministic and a probabilistic algorithm. Tractographies were processed on pre- and postoperatively acquired data. RESULTS: Using a linear mixed effects statistical model, best correlation between subcortical stimulation intensity and the distance between tractography and stimulation sites was achieved by using the segmented motor cortex as seeding ROI and applying the probabilistic algorithm on preoperatively acquired imaging sequences. Tractographies based on fMRI or nTMS results differed very little, but with enlargement of positive nTMS sites the stimulation-distance correlation of nTMS-based tractography improved. CONCLUSION: Our results underline that the use of tractography demands for careful interpretation of its virtual results by considering all influencing variables.},

Quantification of diffusion characteristics inside a fiber bundle provides new insights for disease evolutions, therapy effects, and surgical interventions. In this paper, we present a novel method for segmenting fiber bundles using spherical harmonic coefficients (SHC) that describe diffusion signal obtained from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) protocols. Based on SHC, we define a similarity measure and use it as a speed function term in level set framework. We show advantages of the proposed measure over similarity measures based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) indices. Without any assumptions about diffusion model, we deal with diffusion signal instead of orientation distribution function (ODF) calculated using complicated mathematics, inaccurate simplifications, and time-consuming implementation. By applying the proposed algorithm on synthetic data, its superior accuracy and robustness in low SNR conditions are shown. Application of the proposed method on real HARDI MRI data also illustrates its superior performance, especially in heterogeneous diffusion areas with low traditional diffusion anisotropies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop an automatic atlas-based method for segmentation of fiber bundles using High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) data. Hypothesis: Quantitative evaluation of diffusion characteristics inside specific fiber bundles provides new insights into disease developments, evolutions, therapy effects, and surgical interventions. Background: Most of previous segmentation methods use similarity measures and strategies that do not lead to accurate segmentation results. They also suffer from subjectivity of initial seeds and regions of interest (ROI) defined by operator. Materials and methods: We propose a novel method that uses Spherical Harmonic Coefficients (SHC) of HARDI diffusion signals to compute Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) and to extract Principal Diffusion Directions (PDDs). The proposed method selects most collinear PDD of neighbors of each voxel. Then, based on SHC and selected PDD, a similarity measure is proposed and used as a speed function in the level set framework that segments fiber bundles. To automate the process, an atlas-based method is used to select initial seeds for fiber bundles. To generate data for evaluation of the proposed method, an artificial pattern consisting of three crossing bundles intersected by a circular bundle is created. Also, two normal controls are imaged by two different HARDI protocols. Results: Segmentation results for different fiber bundles in simulated data and normal control data are presented. Influence of threshold selection on the proposed segmentation method is evaluated using Dice coefficient. Also, effect of increasing the number of gradient directions on accuracy of extracted PDDs is evaluated. Conclusion: The proposed segmentation method has advantages over previous methods especially those that use similarity measures based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. These advantages are achieved by proper propagation of a hyper-surface in fiber crossing areas without making assumptions about diffusivity profile and selection of initial seeds or ROI. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The recently presented evaluation framework Tractometer is the first attempt to approach this challenge in a quantitative, comparative, persistent and open-access way. Tractometer is currently based on the evaluation of several global connectivity and tract-overlap metrics on hardware phantom data.The work presented in this paper focuses on extending Tractometer with a metric that enables the assessment of the local consistency of tractograms with the underlying image data that is not only applicable to phantom dataset but allows the quantitative and purely data-driven evaluation of in-vivo tractography. We furthermore present an extensive reference-based evaluation study of 25,000 tractograms obtained on phantom and in-vivo datasets using the presented local metric as well as all the methods already established in Tractometer.The experiments showed that the presented local metric successfully reflects the behavior of in-vivo tractography under different conditions and that it is consistent with the results of previous studies. Additionally our experiments enabled a multitude of conclusions with implications for fiber tractography in general, including recommendations regarding optimal choice of a local modeling technique, tractography algorithm, and parameterization, confirming and complementing the results of earlier studies.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) techniques are widely used for identifying the corticospinal tract (CST) white matter pathways as part of presurgical planning. However, mass effects in patients with brain tumors tend to cause anatomical distortions and compensatory functional reorganization of the cortex, which may lead to inaccurate mapping of white matter tracts. To overcome these problems, we compared different region-of-interest (ROI) selection schemes to track CST fibers in patients with brain tumors. Our study investigated the CSTs of 16 patients with intracranial tumors. The patients were classified into 3 subgroups according to the spatial relationships of the lesion and the primary motor cortex (PMC)/internal capsule. Specifically, we investigated the key factors that cause distorted tractography in patients with tumors. We compared 3 CST tractography methods that used different ROI selection schemes. The results indicate that CST fiber tracking methods based only on anatomical ROIs could possibly lead to distortions near the PMC region and may be unable to effectively localize the PMC. In contrast, the dual ROI method, which uses ROIs that have been selected from both blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) activation and anatomical landmarks, enabled the tracking of fibers to the motor cortex. The results demonstrate that the dual ROI method can localize the entire CST fiber pathway and can accurately describe the spatial relationships of CST fibers relative to the tumor. These results illustrate the reliability of using fMRI-guided DTT in patients with tumors. The combination of fMRI and anatomical information enhances the identification of tracts of interest in brains with anatomical deformations, which provides neurosurgeons with a more accurate approach for visualizing and localizing white matter fiber tracts in patients with brain tumors. This approach enhances surgical performance and perserves brain function.},

Having originated within the realm of diffusion NMR in the late 1970s, this field is experiencing an exponential growth in the number of publications. At the same time, model-based approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about two decades of intellectual and financial investment, microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow progress in clinical translation may signify unresolved fundamental problems. We outline such problems and related practical pitfalls, as well as review strategies for developing and validating tissue microstructure models, to provoke a discussion on how to bridge the gap between our scientific aspirations and the clinical reality. We argue for recalibrating the efforts of our community toward a more systematic focus on fundamental research aimed at identifying relevant degrees of freedom affecting the measured MR signal. Such a focus is essential for realizing the truly revolutionary potential of noninvasive three-dimensional in vivo microstructural mapping.},

Determination of distorted brain anatomy surrounding a tumor causing a mass effect is much more difficult than interpretation of normal brain scans, particularly because this distortion is not easily predictable a tumor may be located in any place and vary substantially in size, shape, and radiological appearance. The objective of our work is to provide a qualitative means for rapid estimation of brain anatomy distorted by tumor. Materials and Methods. Toward achieving this objective, we use an electronic and deformable brain atlas of gross anatomy along with a fast atlas-to-data warping technique. The deformed atlas determines the distorted anatomy surrounding a tumor and can be used for structure labeling (naming). The warping algorithm uses the Talairach transformation followed by three-dimensional nonlinear tumor deformation based on a geometric assumption that the tumor, delineated on radiological images, compresses its surrounding tissues radially. Results. The approach is implemented and a dedicated application is developed. It processes the data automatically in five steps: (1) load data, (2) set the Talairach landmarks and perform the Talairach transformation, (3) segment the tumor, (4) warp the scan nonlinearly in three dimensions, and (5) explore the scan. The approach is very fast, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan is processed in 10-15 seconds on a standard personal computer. It is fully automatic and gives the user control over the entire process. Conclusion. Despite its limitations in modeling and validation, this practical solution provides a rapid and potentially useful qualitative assessment of anatomy deformed by a mass effect tumor. © AUR, 2005.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for the automated identification of key white matter fiber tracts for neurosurgical planning, and we apply the method in a retrospective study of 18 consecutive neurosurgical patients with brain tumors. Our method is designed to be relatively robust to challenges in neurosurgical tractography, which include peritumoral edema, displacement, and mass effect caused by mass lesions. The proposed method has two parts. First, we learn a data-driven white matter parcellation or fiber cluster atlas using groupwise registration and spectral clustering of multi-fiber tractography from healthy controls. Key fiber tract clusters are identified in the atlas. Next, patient-specific fiber tracts are automatically identified using tractography-based registration to the atlas and spectral embedding of patient tractography. Results indicate good generalization of the data-driven atlas to patients: 80\% of the 800 fiber clusters were identified in all 18 patients, and 94\% of the 800 fiber clusters were found in 16 or more of the 18 patients. Automated subject-specific tract identification was evaluated by quantitative comparison to subject-specific motor and language functional MRI, focusing on the arcuate fasciculus (language) and corticospinal tracts (motor), which were identified in all patients. Results indicate good colocalization: 89 of 95, or 94\%, of patient-specific language and motor activations were intersected by the corresponding identified tract. All patient-specific activations were within 3mm of the corresponding language or motor tract. Overall, our results indicate the potential of an automated method for identifying fiber tracts of interest for neurosurgical planning, even in patients with mass lesions.},

  abstract = {Adopting a network perspective, the structural connectome reveals the large-scale white matter connectivity of the human brain, yielding insights into cerebral organization otherwise inaccessible to researchers and clinicians. Connectomics has great potential for elucidating abnormal connectivity in congenital brain malformations, especially axonal pathfinding disorders. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is one of the most common brain malformations and can also be considered a prototypical genetic disorder of axonal guidance in humans. In this exploratory study, the structural connectome of AgCC is mapped and compared to that of the normal human brain. Multiple levels of granularity of the AgCC connectome are investigated, including summary network metrics, modularity analysis, and network consistency measures, with comparison to the normal structural connectome after simulated removal of all callosal connections ("virtual callostomy"). These investigations reveal four major findings. First, global connectivity is abnormally reduced in AgCC, but local connectivity is increased. Second, the network topology of AgCC is more variable than that of the normal human connectome, contradicting the predictions of the virtual callostomy model. Third, modularity analysis reveals that many of the tracts that comprise the structural core of the cerebral cortex have relatively weak connectivity in AgCC, especially the cingulate bundles bilaterally. Finally, virtual lesions of the Probst bundles in the AgCC connectome demonstrate that there is consistency across subjects in many of the connections generated by these ectopic white matter tracts, and that they are a mixture of cortical and subcortical fibers. These results go beyond prior diffusion tractography studies to provide a systems-level perspective on anomalous connectivity in AgCC. Furthermore, this work offers a proof of principle for the utility of the connectome framework in neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The structural connectome has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize the network architecture of the human brain and shows great potential for generating important new biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The edges of the cerebral graph traverse white matter to interconnect cortical and subcortical nodes, although the anatomic embedding of these edges is generally overlooked in the literature. Mapping the paths of the connectome edges could elucidate the relative importance of individual white matter tracts to the overall network topology of the brain and also lead to a better understanding of the effect of regionally-specific white matter pathology on cognition and behavior. In this work, we introduce edge density imaging (EDI), which maps the number of network edges that pass through every white matter voxel. Test-retest analysis shows good to excellent reliability for edge density (ED) measurements, with consistent results using different cortical and subcortical parcellation schemes and different diffusion MR imaging acquisition parameters. We also demonstrate that ED yields complementary information to both traditional and emerging voxel-wise metrics of white matter microstructure and connectivity, including fractional anisotropy, track density, fiber orientation dispersion and neurite density. Our results demonstrate spatially ordered variations of ED throughout the white matter, notably including greater ED in posterior than anterior cerebral white matter. The EDI framework is employed to map the white matter regions that are enriched with pathways connecting rich club nodes and also those with high densities of intra-modular and inter-modular edges. We show that periventricular white matter has particularly high ED and high densities of rich club edges, which is significant for diseases in which these areas are selectively affected, ranging from white matter injury of prematurity in infants to leukoaraiosis in the elderly. Using edge betweenness centrality, we identify specific white matter regions involved in a large number of shortest paths, some containing highly connected rich club edges while others are relatively isolated within individual modules. Overall, these findings reveal an intricate relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome, motivating further exploration of EDI for biomarkers of cognition and behavior.},

This was accomplished with the use of an expression that generalizes the evaluation of the trace operator to tensors of arbitrary rank, and even to functions whose domains are the unit sphere. It is shown that the mean diffusivity is invariant to the selection of tensor rank for the model used. However, this rank invariance does not apply to the anisotropy measures. Therefore, a variance-based, general anisotropy measure is proposed. Also an information theoretical parametrization of anisotropy is introduced that is frequently more consistent with the meaning attributed to anisotropy. We accomplished this by associating anisotropy with the amount of orientational information present in the data, regardless of the imaging technique used. Using a simplified model of fibrous tissue, we simulated anisotropy values with varying orientational complexity and tensor models. Simulations suggested that a lower-rank tensor model may produce artificially low anisotropy values in voxels with complex structure. This was confirmed with a spin-echo experiment performed on an excised rat brain. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here we report the distribution of ventricular volume relative to sulcal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, and the association of increasing ventricular volume relative to sulcal CSF volume with a cluster of gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence in a stroke-free cohort of elderly persons from the general population. Methods: Data are based on 858 persons (35.4\% men; age range, 66-92 years) who participated in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study. Gait was evaluated with an assessment of gait speed. Composite scores representing speed of processing, memory, and executive function were constructed from a neuropsychological battery. Bladder function was assessed with a questionnaire. Magnetic resonance brain imaging was followed by semiautomated segmentation of intracranial CSF volume. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume was assessed with a semiquantitative scale. For the analysis of ventricular dilation relative to the sulcal spaces, ventricular volume was divided by sulcal CSF volume (VV/SV). Results: Disproportion between ventricular and sulcal CSF volume, defined as the highest quartile of the VV/SV z score, was associated with gait impairment (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.3) and cognitive impairment (OR, 1.8; 95\% CI, 1.1-3.0). We did not find an association between the VV/SV z score and bladder dysfunction. Interpretation: The prevalence and severity of gait impairment and cognitive impairment increases with ventricular dilation in persons without stroke from the general population, independent of WMH volume. © 2009 American Neurological Association.},

  abstract = {Awake craniotomies (ACs) have become more widely used for glioma patients. In this chapter we will discuss the most recent available data for ACs performed with local anesthesia in comparison with craniotomies under general anesthesia (GA). Originally, ACs were used for epilepsy surgery, but it is now being used in the neuro-oncology field for glioma resection. As with every surgical technique, advantages and disadvantages coexist. Therefore it is imperative to select the most beneficial technique for each patient. Recent evidence suggests that glioma patients tend to benefit from awake procedures. This is due to the surgeon’s ability to perform more accurate cortical and subcortical stimulation, obtain a higher extent of resection, achieve better overall postoperative outcomes, achieve lower rates of postoperative complications which directly impact the patient’s quality of life (QoL), provide a shorter hospital stay, and lower overall health-care costs. However, during awake procedures, breathing rate cannot be controlled, making it difficult to have a controlled CO2 to reduce brain swelling. Awake procedures may also have a big impact on the psyche of the patient, and some of them are not able to tolerate the procedure. In these cases, GA is advantageous, and this technique is still widely used around the globe. Deep sedation is a good alternative for failed procedures, as well as for interventions in which patient positioning does not allow for an awake procedure. Even though GA has its benefits, in the right patient, craniotomies with local anesthesia tend to be more advantageous and provide a better postoperative outcome with a better QoL for the patient.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for an accurate model of the diffusion MR signal in white matter of the brain. We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal spaces. We devise a new diffusion MRI protocol that provides measurements with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such as ball and stick or CHARMED, generally explain the data better than those that do not, such as the DT or the biexponential models. However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor (DT) model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Preoperative tractography permits both qualitative and quantitative analyses of tumor effects upon surrounding white matter, allowing the surgeon to specifically tailor their operative approach. Despite its benefits, there is controversy pertaining to methodology, implementation, and interpretation of results in this context. High-definition fiber tractography (HDFT) is one of several non-tensor tractography approaches permitting visualization of crossing white matter trajectories at high resolutions, dispensing with the well-known shortcomings of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. In this article, we provide an overview of the advantages of HDFT in a neurosurgical context, derived from our considerable experience implementing the technique for academic and clinical purposes. We highlight nuances of qualitative and quantitative approaches to using HDFT for brain tumor surgery planning, and integration of tractography with complementary operative adjuncts, and consider areas requiring further research.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) may play an important role in several aspects of language processing such as visual object recognition, visual memory, lexical retrieval, reading, and specifically, in naming visual stimuli. In particular, the ILF appears to convey visual information from the occipital lobe to the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). However, direct evidence proving the essential role of the ILF in language and semantics remains limited and controversial. The first aim of this study was to prove that patients with a brain glioma damaging the left ILF would be selectively impaired in picture naming of objects; the second aim was to prove that patients with glioma infiltrating the ATL would not be impaired due to functional reorganization of the lexical retrieval network elicited by the tumor. We evaluated 48 right-handed patients with neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after surgery for resection of a glioma infiltrating aspects of the left temporal, occipital, and/or parietal lobes; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired preoperatively in all patients. Damage to the ILF, inferior frontal occipital fasciculus (IFOF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), arcuate fasciculus (AF), and associated cortical regions was assessed by means of preoperative tractography and pre-/pos-toperative MRI volumetry. The association of fascicles damage with patients' performance in picture naming and three additional cognitive tasks, namely, verbal fluency (two verbal non-visual tasks) and the Trail Making Test (a visual attentional task), was evaluated. Nine patients were impaired in the naming test before surgery. ILF damage was demonstrated with tractography in six (67\%) of these patients. The odds of having an ILF damage was 6.35 (95\% CI: 1.27-34.92) times higher among patients with naming deficit than among those without it. The ILF was the only fascicle to be significantly associated with naming deficit when all the fascicles were considered together, achieving an adjusted odds ratio of 15.73 (95\% CI: 2.30-178.16, p\,=\,.010). Tumor infiltration of temporal and occipital cortices did not contribute to increase the odd of having a naming deficit. ILF damage was found to be selectively associated with picture naming deficit and not with lexical retrieval assessed by means of verbal fluency. Early after surgery, 29 patients were impaired in naming objects. The association of naming deficit with percentage of ILF resection (assessed by 3D-MRI) was confirmed (beta\,=\,-56.78\,±\,20.34, p\,=\,.008) through a robust multiple linear regression model; no significant association was found with damage of IFOF, UF or AF. Crucially, postoperative neuropsychological evaluation showed that naming scores of patients with tumor infiltration of the anterior temporal cortex were not significantly associated with the percentage of ILF damage (rho\,=\,.180, p\,{$>$}\,.999), while such association was significant in patients without ATL infiltration (rho\,=\,-.556, p\,=\,.004). The ILF is selectively involved in picture naming of objects; however, the naming deficits are less severe in patients with glioma infiltration of the ATL probably due to release of an alternative route that may involve the posterior segment of the AF. The left ILF, connecting the extrastriatal visual cortex to the anterior region of the temporal lobe, is crucial for lexical retrieval on visual stimulus, such as in picture naming. However, when the ATL is also damaged, an alternative route is released and the performance improves.},

In the primate brain, a 'ventral' pathway is thought to project anteriorly from the primary auditory cortex to prefrontal areas along the superior temporal gyrus while a separate 'dorsal' route connects these areas posteriorly via the inferior parietal lobe. We use diffusion MRI tractography, a noninvasive technique based on diffusion-weighted MRI, to investigate the possibility of a similar pattern of connectivity in the human brain for the first time. The dorsal pathway from Wernicke's area to Broca's area is shown to include the arcuate fasciculus and connectivity to Brodmann area 40, lateral superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), and lateral middle temporal gyrus. A ventral route between Wernicke's area and Broca's area is demonstrated that connects via the external capsule/uncinate fasciculus and the medial superior temporal gyrus. Ventral connections are also observed in the lateral superior and middle temporal gyri. The connections are stronger in the dominant hemisphere, in agreement with previous studies of functional lateralization of auditory-language processing. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Diffusion weighted (DW) MRI facilitates non-invasive quantification of tissue microstructure and, in combination with appropriate signal processing, three-dimensional estimates of fibrous orientation. In recent years, attention has shifted from the diffusion tensor model, which assumes a unimodal Gaussian diffusion displacement profile to recover fibre orientation (with various well-documented limitations), towards more complex high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) analysis techniques.Spherical deconvolution (SD) approaches assume that the fibre orientation density function (fODF) within a voxel can be obtained by deconvolving a 'common' single fibre response function from the observed set of DW signals. In practice, this common response function is not known a priori and thus an estimated fibre response must be used. Here the establishment of this single-fibre response function is referred to as 'calibration'. This work examines the vulnerability of two different SD approaches to inappropriate response function calibration: (1) constrained spherical harmonic deconvolution (CSHD)-a technique that exploits spherical harmonic basis sets and (2) damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) deconvolution-a technique based on the standard Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.Through simulations, the impact of a discrepancy between the calibrated diffusion profiles and the observed ('Target') DW-signals in both single and crossing-fibre configurations was investigated. The results show that CSHD produces spurious fODF peaks (consistent with well known ringing artefacts) as the discrepancy between calibration and target response increases, while dRL demonstrates a lower over-all sensitivity to miscalibration (with a calibration response function for a highly anisotropic fibre being optimal). However, dRL demonstrates a reduced ability to resolve low anisotropy crossing-fibres compared to CSHD. It is concluded that the range and spatial-distribution of expected single-fibre anisotropies within an image must be carefully considered to ensure selection of the appropriate algorithm, parameters and calibration. Failure to choose the calibration response function carefully may severely impact the quality of any resultant tractography. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

  abstract = {MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain and spine provides a unique tool for both visualizing directionality and assessing intactness of white matter fiber tracts in vivo. At the spatial resolution of clinical MRI, much of primate white matter is composed of interdigitating fibers. Analyses based on an assumed single diffusion tensor per voxel yield important information about the average diffusion in the voxel but fail to reveal structure in the presence of crossing tracts. Until today, all clinical scans assume only one tensor, causing potential serious errors in tractography. Since high angular resolution imaging remains, so far, untenable for routine clinical use, a method is proposed whereby the single-tensor field is augmented with additional information gleaned from standard clinical DTI. The method effectively resolves two distinct tract directions within voxels, in which only two tracts are assumed to exist. The underlying constrained two-tensor model is fitted in two stages, utilizing the information present in the single-tensor fit. As a result, the necessary MRI time can be drastically reduced when compared with other approaches, enabling widespread clinical use. Upon evaluation in simulations and application to in vivo human brain DTI data, the method appears to be robust and practical and, if correctly applied, could elucidate tract directions at critical points of uncertainty. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is a successful treatment for medically-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the language-dominant hemisphere, 30\%- 50\% of individuals experience a naming decline which can impact upon daily life. Measures of structural networks are associated with language performance pre-operatively. It is unclear if analysis of network measures may predict post-operative decline. METHODS: White matter fibre tractography was performed on preoperative diffusion MRI of 44 left lateralised and left resection individuals with TLE to reconstruct the preoperative structural network. Resection masks, drawn on co-registered pre- and post-operative T1-weighted MRI scans, were used as exclusion regions on pre-operative tractography to estimate the post-operative network. Changes in graph theory metrics, cortical strength, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient were generated by comparing the estimated pre- and post-operative networks. These were thresholded based on the presence of the connection in each patient, ranging from 75\% to 100\% in steps of 5\%. The average graph theory metric across thresholds was taken. We incorporated leave-one-out cross-validation with smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection and a support vector classifier to assess graph theory metrics on picture naming decline. Picture naming was assessed via the Graded Naming Test preoperatively and at 3 and 12~months post-operatively and the outcome was classified using the reliable change index (RCI) to identify clinically significant decline. The best feature combination and model was selected using the area under the curve (AUC). The sensitivity, specificity and F1-score were also reported. Permutation testing was performed to assess the machine learning model and selected regions difference significance. RESULTS: A combination of clinical and graph theory metrics were able to classify outcome of picture naming at 3~months with an AUC of 0.84. At 12~months, change in strength to cortical regions was best able to correctly classify outcome with an AUC of 0.86. Longitudinal analysis revealed that betweenness centrality was the best metric to identify patients who declined at 3~months, who will then continue to experience decline from 3 to 12~months. Both models were significantly higher AUC values than a random classifier. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inferred changes of network integrity were able to correctly classify picture naming decline after ATLR. These measures may be used to prospectively to identify patients who are at risk of picture naming decline after surgery and could potentially be utilised to assist tailoring the resection in order to prevent this decline.},

  abstract = {Indices of diffusion anisotropy calculated from diffusion coefficients acquired in two or three perpendicular directions are rotationally variant. In living monkey brain, these indices severely underestimate the degree of diffusion anisotropy. New indices calculated from the entire diffusion tensor are rotationally invariant (RI). They show that anisotropy is highly variable in different white matter regions depending on the degree of coherence of fiber tract directions. In structures with a regular, parallel fiber arrangement, water diffusivity in the direction parallel to the fibers (Dparallel approximately 1400-1800 x 10(-6) mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the average diffusivity in directions perpendicular to them (D + D)/2 [corrected] approximately 150-300 x 10(-6) mm2/s), and is almost three times higher than previously reported. In structures where the fiber pattern is less coherent (e.g., where fiber bundles merge), diffusion anisotropy is significantly reduced. However, RI anisotropy indices are still susceptible to noise contamination. Monte Carlo simulations show that these indices are statistically biased, particularly those requiring sorting of the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor based on their magnitude. A new intervoxel anisotropy index is proposed that locally averages inner products between diffusion tensors in neighboring voxels. This "lattice" RI index has an acceptably low error variance and is less susceptible to bias than any other RI anisotropy index proposed to date.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collection is described in terms of pulse sequences, i.e. prescribed temporal applications of radio-frequency and gradient magnetic fields, which are in turn used for signal creation, spatial encoding, and control of image contrast. The pulse sequence determines what the image will look like, including the type of image contrast, and its resolution and quality. Understanding pulse sequences used for diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI requires some level of understanding of the underlying physics of MRI. Magnetic resonance images primarily reflect water and fat concentration; specifically, they reflect the signal from hydrogen nuclei. Additional gradient magnetic fields can be used in a pulse sequence to make the MR image contrast sensitive to thermal motion of water, but the resulting sensitization to cardiac and patient motion must be accounted for in order to obtain high quality images with meaningful information. Almost any MRI pulse sequence can be modified to become sensitive to diffusion. Very large diffusion-weighting gradients are required to produce incoherent phase shifts sufficient to produce signal decay in the presence of microscopic thermal motion. This feature of diffusion-weighted MRI is also its single greatest challenge. Given the challenges of multi-shot DWI, the most common pulse sequence for DW MRI is currently single-shot Echo Planar Imaging (SSEPI). The single-shot nature of this method, beyond removing disparities in the motion-induced phase of the data, also makes it a very fast imaging method. © 2009 Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms have recently been proposed as an alternative to traditional tractography methods in order to address some of their weaknesses. They can be path-based and local-model-free, and easily incorporate anatomical priors to make contextual and non-local decisions that should help the tracking process. ML-based techniques have thus shown promising reconstructions of larger spatial extent of existing white matter bundles, promising reconstructions of less false positives, and promising robustness to known position and shape biases of current tractography techniques. But as of today, none of these ML-based methods have shown conclusive performances or have been adopted as a de facto solution to tractography. One reason for this might be the lack of well-defined and extensive frameworks to train, evaluate, and compare these methods. In this paper, we describe several datasets and evaluation tools that contain useful features for ML algorithms, along with the various methods proposed in the recent years. We then discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate and compare those methods, as well as their shortcomings. Finally, we describe the particular needs of ML tractography methods and discuss tangible solutions for future works.},

  abstract = {Obtaining validation data and comparison metrics for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) are difficult tasks due to the lack of reliable ground truth. This problem is even more evident for images presenting pathology, which can both alter tissue appearance through infiltration and cause geometric distortions. Systems for generating synthetic images with user-defined degradation by noise and intensity inhomogeneity offer the possibility for testing and comparison of segmentation methods. Such systems do not yet offer simulation of sufficiently realistic looking pathology. This paper presents a system that combines physical and statistical modeling to generate synthetic multi-modal 3D brain MRI with tumor and edema, along with the underlying anatomical ground truth, Main emphasis is placed on simulation of the major effects known for tumor MRI, such as contrast enhancement, local distortion of healthy tissue, infiltrating edema adjacent to tumors, destruction and deformation of fiber tracts, and multi-modal MRI contrast of healthy tissue and pathology. The new method synthesizes pathology in multi-modal MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by simulating mass effect, warping and destruction of white matter fibers, and infiltration of brain tissues by tumor cells. We generate synthetic contrast enhanced MR images by simulating the accumulation of contrast agent within the brain. The appearance of the the brain tissue and tumor in MRI is simulated by synthesizing texture images from real MR images. The proposed method is able to generate synthetic ground truth and synthesized MR images with tumor and edema that exhibit comparable segmentation challenges to real tumor MRI. Such image data sets will find use in segmentation reliability studies, comparison and validation of different segmentation methods, training and teaching, or even in evaluating standards for tumor size like the RECIST criteria (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Individualized tractography reconstructions of white matter pathways associated with motor, language or vision have the potential to provide clinically relevant information during surgical planning of brain tumor resection, and the technique is gaining increasing interest as a non invasive brain mapping tool.

While the correction tools used in the HCP Pipeline greatly reduce the distortion artifacts in the preprocessed data, significant residual distortions are still widely present, especially in the brainstem region. One fundamental reason is that the topup tool used in the HCP Pipeline only relies on the B0 images, which lack sufficient contrast about white matter pathways, to estimate the distortion displacement between opposite phase encodings (PEs). To fully utilize the rich information of HCP data that includes dMRI data from two opposite PEs, we compute the fiber orientation distributions (FODs) from the data of each PE and propose a novel method to estimate and correct the residual distortion using FOD-based registration. Using the dMRI data of 94 HCP subjects, we show quantitatively that our method can reduce the misalignment of main fiber direction in the brainstem by 21\% as compared to the topup tool used in the HCP Pipeline. Our method is fully compatible with the HCP Pipeline and thus can be readily integrated with it to enhance distortion correction in connectome imaging research.},

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of applying intraoperative resting-state functional MR imaging for the safe resection of gliomas using real-time motor cortex mapping during an operation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using interventional MR imaging, we conducted preoperative and intraoperative resting-state intrinsic functional connectivity analyses of the motor cortex in 30 patients with brain tumors. Factors that may influence intraoperative imaging quality, including anesthesia type (general or awake anesthesia) and tumor cavity (filled with normal saline or not), were studied to investigate image quality. Additionally, direct cortical stimulation was used to validate the accuracy of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in mapping the motor cortex. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative resting-state fMRI scans were acquired for all patients. Fourteen patients who successfully completed both sufficient intraoperative resting-state fMRI and direct cortical stimulation were used for further analysis of sensitivity and specificity. Compared with those subjected to direct cortical stimulation, the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative resting-state fMRI in localizing the motor area were 61.7\% and 93.7\%, respectively. The image quality of intraoperative resting-state fMRI was better when the tumor cavity was filled with normal saline (P = .049). However, no significant difference between the anesthesia types was observed (P = .102). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using intraoperative resting-state fMRI for real-time localization of functional areas during a neurologic operation. The findings suggest that using intraoperative resting-state fMRI can avoid the risk of intraoperative seizures due to direct cortical stimulation and may provide neurosurgeons with valuable information to facilitate the safe resection of gliomas. © 2017 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The ability of functional MRI (fMRI) to localize patient-specific eloquent areas has proved worthwhile in efforts to maximize resection while minimizing risk of iatrogenic damage in patients with brain tumors. Although cortical reorganization has been described, the frequency of its occurrence and the factors that influence incidence are not well understood. The authors investigated changes in language laterality between 2 fMRI studies in patients with brain tumors to elucidate factors contributing to cortical reorganization.                                         METHODS               The authors analyzed 33 patients with brain tumors involving eloquent language areas who underwent 2 separate presurgical, language task–based fMRI examinations (fMRI1 and fMRI2). Pathology consisted of low-grade glioma (LGG) in 15, and high-grade glioma (HGG) in 18. The mean time interval between scans was 35 ± 38 months (mean ± SD). Regions of interest were drawn for Broca’s area (BA) and the contralateral BA homolog. The laterality index (LI) was calculated and categorized as follows: {$>$} 0.2, left dominance; 0.2 to –0.2, codominance; and {$<$} −0.2, right dominance. Translocation of language function was defined as a shift across one of these thresholds between the 2 scans. Comparisons between the 2 groups, translocation of language function (reorganized group) versus no translocation (constant group), were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.                                         RESULTS               Nine (27\%) of 33 patients demonstrated translocation of language function. Eight of 9 patients with translocation had tumor involvement of BA, compared to 5/24 patients without translocation (p {$<$} 0.0001). There was no difference in LI between the 2 groups at fMRI1. However, the reorganized group showed a decreased LI at fMRI2 compared to the constant group (−0.1 vs 0.53, p {$<$} 0.01). The reorganized cohort showed a significant difference between LI1 and LI2 (0.50 vs –0.1, p {$<$} 0.0001) whereas the constant cohort did not. A longer time interval was found in the reorganized group between fMRI1 and fMRI2 for patients with LGG (34 vs 107 months, p {$<$} 0.002). Additionally, the reorganized cohort had a greater proportion of local tumor invasion into eloquent areas at fMRI2 than the constant group. Aphasia was present following fMRI2 in 13/24 (54\%) patients who did not exhibit translocation, compared to 2/9 (22\%) patients who showed translocation.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Translocation of language function in patients with brain tumor is associated with tumor involvement of BA, longer time intervals between scans, and is seen in both LGG and HGG. The reduced incidence of aphasia in the reorganized group raises the possibility that reorganization supports the conservation of language function. Therefore, longitudinal fMRI is useful because it may point to reorganization and could affect therapeutic planning for patients.},

  abstract = {Objectives To compare five different seeding methods to delineate hand, foot, and lip components of the corticospinal tract (CST) using single tensor tractography. Methods We studied five healthy subjects and 10 brain tumor patients. For each subject, we used five different seeding methods, from (1) cerebral peduncle (CP), (2) posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), (3) white matter subjacent to functional MRI activations (fMRI), (4) whole brain and then selecting the fibers that pass through both fMRI and CP (WBF-CP), and (5) whole brain and then selecting the fibers that pass through both fMRI and PLIC (WBF-PLIC). Two blinded neuroradiologists rated delineations as anatomically successful or unsuccessful tractography. The proportions of successful trials from different methods were compared by Fisher's exact test. Results To delineate hand motor tract, seeding through fMRI activation areas was more effective than through CP (p {$<$} 0.01), but not significantly different from PLIC (p {$>$} 0.1). WBF-CP delineated hand motor tracts in a larger proportion of trials than CP alone (p {$<$} 0.05). Similarly, WBF-PLIC depicted hand motor tracts in a larger proportion of trials than PLIC alone (p {$<$} 0.01). Foot motor tracts were delineated in all trials by either PLIC or whole brain seeding (WBF-CP and WBF-PLIC). Seeding from CP or fMRI activation resulted in foot motor tract visualization in 87\% of the trials (95\% confidence interval: 60-98\%). The lip motor tracts were delineated only by WBF-PLIC and in 36\% of trials (95\% confidence interval: 11-69\%). Conclusions Whole brain seeding and then selecting the tracts that pass through two anatomically relevant ROIs can delineate more plausible hand and lip motor tracts than seeding from a single ROI. Foot motor tracts can be successfully delineated regardless of the seeding method used.},

  abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted images is an important step in comparing white matter fibre bundles across subjects, or in the same subject at different time points. Using diffusion-weighted imaging, Spherical Deconvolution enables multiple fibre populations within a voxel to be resolved by computing the fibre orientation distribution (FOD). In this paper, we present a novel method that employs FODs for the registration of diffusion-weighted images. Registration was performed by optimising a symmetric diffeomorphic non-linear transformation model, using image metrics based on the mean squared difference, and cross-correlation of the FOD spherical harmonic coefficients. The proposed method was validated by recovering known displacement fields using FODs represented with maximum harmonic degrees (lmax) of 2, 4 and 6. Results demonstrate a benefit in using FODs at lmax=4 compared to lmax=2. However, a decrease in registration accuracy was observed when lmax=6 was used; this was likely caused by noise in higher harmonic degrees. We compared our proposed method to fractional anisotropy driven registration using an identical code base and parameters. FOD registration was observed to perform significantly better than FA in all experiments. The cross-correlation metric performed significantly better than the mean squared difference. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of this method by computing an unbiased group average FOD template that was used for probabilistic fibre tractography. This work suggests that using crossing fibre information aids in the alignment of white matter and could therefore benefit several methods for investigating population differences in white matter, including voxel based analysis, tensor based morphometry, atlas based segmentation and labelling, and group average fibre tractography. © 2010.},

Higher order information provided by FODs could improve several methods for investigating population differences in white matter, including image registration, voxel-based analysis, atlas-based segmentation and labeling, and group average fiber tractography. All of these methods require spatial normalization of FODs. In this article, a novel method to reorient the FOD is presented, which is an important step required for FOD spatial normalization. The proposed method was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative experiments, with numerical simulations and in vivo human data. Results demonstrate that the proposed method improves FOD reorientation accuracy, removes undesired artefacts, and decreases computation time compared to a previous approach. The utility of the proposed method is illustrated by nonlinear FOD spatial normalization of 10 human subjects. Accurate reorientation and normalization of FODs is a critical step toward investigating white matter tissue in the context of multiple fiber orientations. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a new measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) for the analysis of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images using higher-order information provided by fibre orientation distributions (FODs) computed using spherical deconvolution. AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects.A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {In brain regions containing crossing fibre bundles, voxel-average diffusion MRI measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) are difficult to interpret, and lack within-voxel single fibre population specificity. Recent work has focused on the development of more interpretable quantitative measures that can be associated with a specific fibre population within a voxel containing crossing fibres (herein we use fixel to refer to a specific fibre population within a single voxel). Unfortunately, traditional 3D methods for smoothing and cluster-based statistical inference cannot be used for voxel-based analysis of these measures, since the local neighbourhood for smoothing and cluster formation can be ambiguous when adjacent voxels may have different numbers of fixels, or ill-defined when they belong to different tracts. Here we introduce a novel statistical method to perform whole-brain fixel-based analysis called connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE). CFE uses probabilistic tractography to identify structurally connected fixels that are likely to share underlying anatomy and pathology. Probabilistic connectivity information is then used for tract-specific smoothing (prior to the statistical analysis) and enhancement of the statistical map (using a threshold-free cluster enhancement-like approach). To investigate the characteristics of the CFE method, we assessed sensitivity and specificity using a large number of combinations of CFE enhancement parameters and smoothing extents, using simulated pathology generated with a range of test-statistic signal-to-noise ratios in five different white matter regions (chosen to cover a broad range of fibre bundle features). The results suggest that CFE input parameters are relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the simulated pathology. We therefore recommend a single set of CFE parameters that should give near optimal results in future studies where the group effect is unknown. We then demonstrate the proposed method by comparing apparent fibre density between motor neurone disease (MND) patients with control subjects. The MND results illustrate the benefit of fixel-specific statistical inference in white matter regions that contain crossing fibres.},

  abstract = {Voxel-based analysis of diffusion MRI data is increasingly popular. However, most white matter voxels contain contributions from multiple fibre populations (often referred to as crossing fibres), and therefore voxel-averaged quantitative measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) are not fibre-specific and have poor interpretability. Using higher-order diffusion models, parameters related to fibre density can be extracted for individual fibre populations within each voxel (‘fixels’), and recent advances in statistics enable the multi-subject analysis of such data. However, investigating within-voxel microscopic fibre density alone does not account for macroscopic differences in the white matter morphology (e.g. the calibre of a fibre bundle). In this work, we introduce a novel method to investigate the latter, which we call fixel-based morphometry (FBM). To obtain a more complete measure related to the total number of white matter axons, information from both within-voxel microscopic fibre density and macroscopic morphology must be combined. We therefore present the FBM method as an integral piece within a comprehensive fixel-based analysis framework to investigate measures of fibre density, fibre-bundle morphology (cross-section), and a combined measure of fibre density and cross-section. We performed simulations to demonstrate the proposed measures using various transformations of a numerical fibre bundle phantom. Finally, we provide an example of such an analysis by comparing a clinical patient group to a healthy control group, which demonstrates that all three measures provide distinct and complementary information. By capturing information from both sources, the combined fibre density and cross-section measure is likely to be more sensitive to certain pathologies and more directly interpretable.},

In the context of cross-subjects modelling, these so-called fixel-based analyses require identifying equivalent fibre populations. This is usually done post-hoc, after estimating fibre orientations for individual subjects independently and subsequently matching the fixels between subjects. This approach can fail due to individual differences in fibre orientation distributions. Here, we introduce a hierarchical framework for fitting crossing fibre models to diffusion MRI data in a population of subjects. This hierarchical setup guarantees that the crossing fibres are consistent by construction and, therefore, comparable across subjects. We propose an expectation-maximisation approach to fit the model, which can scale to large numbers of subjects. This approach produces a crossing-fibre white matter fibre template, which can be used to estimate fibre-specific parameters that are consistent across subjects and, hence, can be used in fixel-based statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Suboptimal lead placement is one of the most common indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS) revision procedures. Confirming lead placement in relation to the visible anatomical target with dedicated stereotactic imaging before terminating the procedure can mitigate this risk. In this study, the authors examined the accuracy, precision, and safety of intraoperative MRI (iMRI) to both guide and verify lead placement during frame-based stereotactic surgery.                                         METHODS               A retrospective analysis of 650 consecutive DBS procedures for targeting accuracy, precision, and perioperative complications was performed. Frame-based lead placement took place in an operating room equipped with an MRI machine using stereotactic images to verify lead placement before removing the stereotactic frame. Immediate lead relocation was performed when necessary. Systematic analysis of the targeting error was calculated.                                         RESULTS               Verification of 1201 DBS leads with stereotactic MRI was performed in 643 procedures and with stereotactic CT in 7. The mean ± SD of the final targeting error was 0.9 ± 0.3 mm (range 0.1–2.3 mm). Anatomically acceptable lead placement was achieved with a single brain pass for 97\% (n = 1164) of leads; immediate intraoperative relocation was performed in 37 leads (3\%) to obtain satisfactory anatomical placement. General anesthesia was used in 91\% (n = 593) of the procedures. Hemorrhage was noted after 4 procedures (0.6\%); 3 patients (0.4\% of procedures) presented with transient neurological symptoms, and 1 experienced delayed cognitive decline. Two bleeds coincided with immediate relocation (2 of 37 leads, 5.4\%), which contrasts with hemorrhage in 2 (0.2\%) of 1164 leads implanted on the first pass (p = 0.0058). Three patients had transient seizures in the postoperative period. The seizures coincided with hemorrhage in 2 of these patients and with immediate lead relocation in the other. There were 21 infections (3.2\% of procedures, 1.5\% in 3 months) leading to hardware removal. Delayed ({$>$} 3 months) retargeting of 6 leads (0.5\%) in 4 patients (0.6\% of procedures) was performed because of suboptimal stimulation benefit. There were no MRI-related complications, no permanent motor deficits, and no deaths.                                         CONCLUSIONS               To the authors’ knowledge, this is the largest series reporting the use of iMRI to guide and verify lead location during DBS surgery. It demonstrates a high level of accuracy, precision, and safety. Significantly higher hemorrhage was encountered when multiple brain passes were required for lead implantation, although none led to permanent deficit. Meticulous audit and calibration can improve precision and maximize safety.},

All the 18 fiber bundles have been successfully reconstructed, in all the subjects, using the single ROIs provided by the SFM approach, with their reproducibility characterized by the fact that the ROI selection is user independent.

  abstract = {Accurate and consistent segmentation of brain white matter bundles at neonatal stage plays an important role in understanding brain development and detecting white matter abnormalities for the prediction of psychiatric disorders. Due to the complexity of white matter anatomy and the spatial resolution of diffusion-weighted MR imaging, multiple fiber bundles can pass through one voxel. The goal of this study is to assign one or multiple anatomical labels of white matter bundles to each voxel to reflect complex white matter anatomy of the neonatal brain. For this, we develop a supervised multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-kNN) classification algorithm in Riemannian diffusion tensor spaces. Our ML-kNN considers diffusion tensors lying on the Log-Euclidean Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and their corresponding vector space as feature space. The ML-kNN utilizes the maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle to make the prediction of white matter labels by reasoning with the labeling information derived from the neighbors without assuming any probabilistic distribution of the features. We show that our approach automatically learns the number of white matter bundles at a location and provides anatomical annotation of the neonatal white matter. In addition, our approach also provides the binary mask for individual white matter bundles to facilitate tract-based statistical analysis in clinical studies. We apply this method to automatically segment 13 white matter bundles of the neonatal brain and examine the segmentation accuracy against semi-manual labels derived from tractography.},

These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter tract-specific imaging will probably become a major component of clinical neuroradiology. Fiber tracking with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used, but variability is substantial. This article reports the ranges of MR imaging appearance and right-left asymmetry of healthy corticospinal tracts (CST) reconstructed with DTI. METHODS: For 20 healthy volunteers, whole-brain DTI data were coregistered with maps of absolute T1 and T2 relaxation times and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), all acquired at 3T. For each individual, the 2 reconstructed CSTs and their asymmetry were analyzed with respect to the number of fibers reconstructed; tract volume; and individual MR imaging parameters restricted to the tracts. Interscan variability was estimated by repeat imaging of 8 individuals. RESULTS: Reconstructed fiber number and tract volume are highly variable, rendering them insensitive to abnormalities in disease. Individual tract-restricted MR imaging parameters are more constrained, and their population averages and normal ranges are reported. The average populaticn asymmetry is generally zero; therefore, normal ranges for an index of asymmetry are reported. By way of example, CST-restricted MR imaging parameters and their asymmetries are shown to be abnormal in an individual with multiple sclerosis who had a lesion affecting the CST. CONCLUSIONS: The results constitute a normative dataset for the following imaging parameters of the CST: T1, T2, MTR, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, transverse diffusivity, and the 3 diffusion tensor eigenvalues. These data can be used to identify, characterize, and establish the significance of changes in diseases that affect the CST.},

  abstract = {The visualization of diffusion MRI related properties in a comprehensive way is still a challenging problem. We propose a simple visualization technique to give neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons a more direct and personalized view of relevant connectivity patterns estimated from clinically feasible diffusion MRI. The approach, named SPECTRE (Subject sPEcific brain Connectivity display in the Target REgion), is based on tract-weighted imaging, where diffusion MRI streamlines are used to aggregate information from a different MRI contrast. Instead of using native MRI contrasts, we propose to use continuous template information as the underlying contrast for aggregation. In this respect, the SPECTRE approach is complementary to normative approaches where connectivity information is warped from the group level to subject space by anatomical registration. For the purpose of demonstration, we focus the presentation of the SPECTRE approach on the visualization of connectivity patterns in the midbrain regions at the level of subthalamic nucleus due to its importance for deep brain stimulation. The proposed SPECTRE maps are investigated with respect to plausibility, robustness, and test–retest reproducibility. Clear dependencies of reliability measures with respect to the underlying tracking algorithms are observed.},

  abstract = {Recently proposed tractography and connectomics approaches often require a very large number of streamlines, in the order of millions. Generating, storing and interacting with these datasets is currently quite difficult, since they require a lot of space in memory and processing time. Compression is a common approach to reduce data size, a recent method has been proposed consisting in removing collinear points in the streamlines. Removing points from streamlines results in files that cannot be robustly post-processed and interacted with with existing tools, which are for the most part point-based. The aim of this work is to improve visualization, interaction and tractometry algorithms to robustly handle compressed tractography datasets. Our proposed improvements are threefold: i) An efficient loading procedure to improve visualization (reduce memomry usage up to 95\% for a 0.2 mm step size); ii) interaction techniques robust to compressed tractograms; iii) tractometry techniques robust to compressed tractograms to eliminate biased in tract-based statistics. The present work demonstrates the need of correctly handling compressed streamlines to avoid biases in future tractometry and connectomics studies.},

  abstract = {Anatomical white matter bundles vary in shape, size, length, and complexity, making diffusion MRI tractography reconstruction of some bundles more difficult than others. As a result, bundles reconstruction often suffers from a poor spatial extent recovery. To fill-up the white matter volume as much and as best as possible, millions of streamlines can be generated and filtering techniques applied to address this issue. However, well-known problems and biases are introduced such as the creation of a large number of false positives and over-representation of easy-to-track parts of bundles and under-representation of hard-to-track. To address these challenges, we developed a Bundle-Specific Tractography (BST) algorithm. It incorporates anatomical and orientational prior knowledge during the process of streamline tracing to increase reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity and efficiency when reconstructing certain bundles of interest. BST outperforms classical deterministic, probabilistic, and global tractography methods. The increase in anatomically plausible streamlines, with larger spatial coverage, helps to accurately represent the full shape of bundles, which could greatly enhance and robustify tract-based and connectivity-based neuroimaging studies.},

  abstract = {Investigative studies of white matter (WM) brain structures using diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography frequently require manual WM bundle segmentation, often called “virtual dissection.” Human errors and personal decisions make these manual segmentations hard to reproduce, which have not yet been quantified by the dMRI community. It is our opinion that if the field of dMRI tractography wants to be taken seriously as a widespread clinical tool, it is imperative to harmonize WM bundle segmentations and develop protocols aimed to be used in clinical settings. The EADC-ADNI Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol achieved such standardization through a series of steps that must be reproduced for every WM bundle. This article is an observation of the problematic. A specific bundle segmentation protocol was used in order to provide a real-life example, but the contribution of this article is to discuss the need for reproducibility and standardized protocol, as for any measurement tool. This study required the participation of 11 experts and 13 nonexperts in neuroanatomy and “virtual dissection” across various laboratories and hospitals. Intra-rater agreement (Dice score) was approximately 0.77, while inter-rater was approximately 0.65. The protocol provided to participants was not necessarily optimal, but its design mimics, in essence, what will be required in future protocols. Reporting tractometry results such as average fractional anisotropy, volume or streamline count of a particular bundle without a sufficient reproducibility score could make the analysis and interpretations more difficult. Coordinated efforts by the diffusion MRI tractography community are needed to quantify and account for reproducibility of WM bundle extraction protocols in this era of open and collaborative science.},

  abstract = {Efficient communication across fields of research is challenging, especially when they are at opposite ends of the physical and digital spectrum. Neuroanatomy and neuroimaging may seem close to each other. When neuroimaging studies try to isolate structures of interest, according to a specific anatomical definition, a variety of challenges emerge. It is a non-trivial task to convert the neuroanatomical knowledge to instructions and rules to be executed in neuroimaging software. In the process called “virtual dissection” used to isolate coherent white matter structure in tractography, each white matter pathway has its own set of landmarks (regions of interest) used as inclusion and exclusion criteria. The ability to segment and study these pathways is critical for scientific progress, yet, variability may depend on region placement, and be influenced by the person positioning the region (i.e., a rater). When raters’ variability is taken into account, the impact made by each region of interest becomes even more difficult to interpret. A delicate balance between anatomical validity, impact on the virtual dissection and raters’ reproducibility emerge. In this work, we investigate this balance by leveraging manual delineation data of a group of raters from a previous study to quantify which set of landmarks and criteria contribute most to variability in virtual dissection. To supplement our analysis, the variability of each pathway with a region-by-region exploration was performed. We present a detailed exploration and description of each region, the causes of variability and its impacts. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the lessons learned from our previous virtual dissection projects and propose recommendations for future virtual dissection protocols as well as perspectives to reach better community agreement when it comes to anatomical definitions of white matter pathways.},

  abstract = {Objective: Tractography has been used to define the presurgical location of white matter tracts, but this is subjective and time-intensive, making incorporation to imaging workflow at scale problematic. The objective is to validate a fully automated pipeline using the TractSeg algorithm (Wasserthal et al. NeuroImage 2018;183:239–253) to segment the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to the corticospinal tract. Methods: The process of importing a structural MPRAGE sequence and raw diffusion weighted images from PACS, executing the TractSeg algorithm, overlaying the resulting bilateral corticospinal tracts on the MPRAGE image, and exporting this composite image to PACS was automated. This procedure was used to segment the corticospinal tract in 28 patients with brain masses adjacent to or displacing the corticospinal tract. These segmentations were compared with both manual deterministic tractography performed with DSI Studio using seeds placed in the pons and an automated tractography method in DSI Studio. Results: The automated algorithm was able to segment the bilateral corticospinal tracts in all 28 patients whereas the manual reference method and DSI Studio based automated tractography were unsuccessful in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In all cases, the TractSeg segmentations very closely matched the manual segmentations. Also, TractSeg appeared to include larger portions of the lateral corticospinal tract fibers than the other 2 methods. Conclusion: The TractSeg algorithm demonstrated robust performance in segmenting the corticospinal tract in patients with brain tumors adjacent to this tract. The algorithm is fast to perform and has great potential for optimizing and streamlining neurosurgical planning.},

  abstract = {Pre-operative planning and intra-operative guidance in neurosurgery require detailed information about the location of functional areas and their anatomo-functional connectivity. In particular, regarding the language system, post-operative deficits such as aphasia can be avoided. By combining functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, the connectivity between functional areas can be reconstructed by tractography techniques that need to cope with limitations such as limited resolution and low anisotropic diffusion close to functional areas. Tumors pose particular challenges because of edema, displacement effects on brain tissue and infiltration of white matter. Under these conditions, standard fiber tracking methods reconstruct pathways of insufficient quality. Therefore, robust global or probabilistic approaches are required. In this study, two commonly used standard fiber tracking algorithms, streamline propagation and tensor deflection, were compared with a previously published global search, Gibbs tracking and a connection-oriented probabilistic tractography approach. All methods were applied to reconstruct neuronal pathways of the language system of patients undergoing brain tumor surgery, and control subjects. Connections between Broca and Wernicke areas via the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) were validated by a clinical expert to ensure anatomical feasibility, and compared using distance- and diffusion-based similarity metrics to evaluate their agreement on pathway locations. For both patients and controls, a strong agreement between all methods was observed regarding the location of the AF. In case of the IFOF however, standard fiber tracking and Gibbs tracking predominantly identified the inferior longitudinal fasciculus that plays a secondary role in semantic language processing. In contrast, global search resolved connections in almost every case via the IFOF which could be confirmed by probabilistic fiber tracking. The results show that regarding the language system, our global search is superior to clinically applied conventional fiber tracking strategies with results similar to time-consuming global or probabilistic approaches.},

Some views propose a dorsal motor versus ventral semantic division. Others propose division by combinatorial mechanism, with the dorsal stream responsible for combining elements into a sequence and the ventral stream for forming semantic dependencies independent of sequential order. We acquired data from direct cortical stimulation in the left hemisphere in 17 neurosurgical patients and subcortical resection in a subset of 10 patients as part of awake language mapping. Two language tasks were employed: a sentence generation (SG) task tested the ability to form sequential and semantic dependencies, and a picture-word interference (PWI) task manipulated semantic interference. Results show increased error rates in the SG versus PWI task during subcortical testing in the dorsal stream territory, and high error rates in both tasks in the ventral stream territory. Connectivity maps derived from diffusion imaging and seeded in the tumor sites show that patients with more errors in the SG than in the PWI task had tumor locations associated with a dorsal stream connectivity pattern. Patients with the opposite pattern of results had tumor locations associated with a more ventral stream connectivity pattern. These findings provide initial evidence using fiber tract disruption with electrical stimulation that the dorsal pathways are critical for organizing words in a sequence necessary for sentence generation, and the ventral pathways are critical for processing semantic dependencies.},

This paper presents a parallel implementation of a nonrigid image registration algorithm. It takes advantage of shared-memory multiprocessor computer architectures using multithreaded programming by partitioning of data and partitioning of tasks, depending on the computational subproblem. For three different biomedical applications (intraoperative brain deformation, contrast-enhanced MR mammography, intersubject brain registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm is quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to perform the computation of intra-operative brain deformation in less than a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU shared-memory supercomputer (SGI Origin 3800). It is shown that its serial component is no more than 2\% of the total computation time, allowing a speedup of at least a factor of 50. In most cases, the theoretical limit of the speedup is substantially higher (up to 132-fold in the application examples presented in this paper). The parallel implementation of our algorithm is, therefore, capable of solving nonrigid registration problems with short execution time requirements and may be considered an important step in the application of such techniques to clinically important problems such as the computation of brain deformation during cranial image-guided surgery.},

  abstract = {The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), a major ventral white matter pathway, has been shown to be a crucial component of semantic (Moritz-Gasser, Herbet \& Duffau, 2013) and lexical/orthographic (Vandermosten, Boets, Polemans, Sunaert, Wouters \& Ghesquière, 2012) processing. However, recent anatomical studies of the brain have revealed at least two differentiable components of the IFOF: a dorsal component projecting from the frontal lobe to the superior parietal lobule and a ventral component connecting the frontal lobe with the inferior occipital gyrus and posterior temporal lobe (Martino, Brogna, Robles, Vergani \& Duffau, 2010). We have replicated this anatomical division using a deterministic tractography protocol in DTI Studio with high inter-rater reliability (ICC\,{$>$}\,0.9). Furthermore, we provide the first evidence of a functional distinction between these two components. We compared diffusion measures (fractional anisotropy [FA], as well as MD, AD, RD) with reaction times on five different reading tasks: basic naming of pure exception words, regular words, and mixed exception/regular words, and go/no-go tasks involving either pseudohomophone or nonword foils. We found a functional divide in the left IFOF, whereby dorsal FA was correlated with performance on tasks that required higher levels of visual attention and response selection (go/no-go and mixed naming tasks), while ventral FA was more broadly correlated with naming performance. This suggests that the anatomical distinction described by Martino et al. (2010) is indeed mirrored by a functional distinction, and indicates that future investigations of neuroanatomical models of reading and speech production should consider the dorsal and ventral IFOF as separate entities.},

  abstract = {The study of short association fibers is still an incomplete task due to their higher inter-subject variability and the smaller size of this kind of fibers in comparison to known long association bundles. However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases. Results for deterministic and probabilistic tractography data show high reproducibility, especially for probabilistic tractography in HCP data. In comparison to previous work, our atlas features a higher number of bundles and greater cortical surface coverage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance with diffusion tensor image (DTI) may be able to estimate trajectories compatible with subcortical tracts close to brain lesions. A limit of DTI is brain shifting (movement of the brain after dural opening and tumor resection). OBJECTIVE: To calculate the brain shift of trajectories compatible with the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients undergoing glioma resection and predict the shift directions of CST. METHODS: DTI was acquired in 20 patients and carried out through 12 noncollinear directions. Dedicated software "merged" all sequences acquired with tractographic processing and the whole dataset was sent to the neuronavigation system. Preoperative, after dural opening (in 11) and tumor resection (in all) DTI acquisitions were performed to evaluate CST shifting. The extent of shifting was considered as the maximum distance between the preoperative and intraoperative contours of the trajectories. RESULTS: An outward shift of CST was observed in 8 patients and an inward shift in 10 patients during surgery. In the remaining 2 patients, no intraoperative displacement was detected. Only peritumoral edema showed a statistically significant correlation with the amount of shift. In those patients in which DTI was acquired after dural opening as well (11 patients), an outward shifting of CST was evident in that phase. CONCLUSION: The use of intraoperative DTI demonstrated brain shifting of the CST. DTI evaluation of white matter tracts can be used during surgical procedures only if updated with intraoperative acquisitions.},

In this study, we examined the diffusion parameters FA (fractional anisotropy) and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) within the CST in different locations and analyzed their interrater reliability and usefulness for predicting the patients' motor outcome with a precise approach of specific region of interest (ROI) seeding based on the color-coded FA-map. Methods Prospectively collected data of 30 patients undergoing bihemispheric nTMS mapping followed by nTMS-based DTI fiber tracking prior to surgery of motor eloquent high-grade gliomas were analyzed by 2 experienced and 1 unexperienced examiner. The following data were scrutinized for both hemispheres after tractography based on nTMS-motor positive cortical seeds and a 2nd region of interest in one layer of the caudal pons defined by the color-coded FA-map: the pre- and postoperative motor status (day of discharge und 3 months), the closest distance between the tracts and the tumor (TTD), the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The latter as an average within the CST as well as specific values in different locations (peritumoral, mesencephal, pontine). Results Lower average FA-values within the affected CST as well as higher average ADC-values are significantly associated with deteriorated postoperative motor function (p = 0.006 and p = 0.026 respectively). Segmental analysis within the CST revealed that the diffusion parameters are especially disturbed on a peritumoral level and that the degree of their impairment correlates with motor deficits (FA p = 0.065, ADC p = 0.007). No significant segmental variation was seen in the healthy hemisphere. The interrater reliability showed perfect agreement for almost all analyzed parameters. Conclusions Adding diffusion weighted imaging derived information on the structural integrity of the nTMS-based tractography results improves the predictive power for postoperative motor outcome. Utilizing a second subcortical ROI which is specifically seeded based on the color-coded FA map increases the tracking quality of the CST independently of the examiner's experience. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the nTMS-based prediction of the patient's outcome.},

According to the most recent anatomical studies, it may be formed by several layers, suggesting a role in multiple cognitive functions. However, to date, no attempt has been made to dissociate the functional contribution of the IFOF subpathways. In this study, real-time, cortico-subcortical mapping with direct electrostimulation was performed in 111 patients operated on in wide-awake surgery for a right low-grade glioma. Patients performed two behavioral tasks during stimulation, tapping, respectively, mentalizing and visual semantic cognition—two functions supposed to be partly mediated by the IFOF. Responsive white matter sites were first subjected to a clustering analysis to assess potential topological differences in network organization. Then they were used as seeds to generate streamline tractograms based on the HC1021 diffusion dataset (template-based approach). The tractograms obtained for each function were overlapped and contrasted to determine whether some fiber pathways were more frequently involved in one or the other function. The obtained results not only provided strong evidence for a role of the right IFOF in both functions, but also revealed that the tract is dissociable into two functional strata according to a ventral (semantic) and dorsal (mentalizing) compartmentalization. Besides, they showed a high degree of anatomo-functionnal variability across patients in the functional implication of the IFOF, possibly related to symmetrical/hemispheric differences in network organization. Collectively, these findings support the view that the right IFOF is a functionally multi-layered structure, with nevertheless interindividual variations.},

  abstract = {Tactile and movement-related somatosensory perceptions are crucial for our daily lives and survival. Although the primary somatosensory cortex is thought to be the key structure of somatosensory perception, various cortical downstream areas are also involved in somatosensory perceptual processing. However, little is known about whether cortical networks of these downstream areas can be dissociated depending on each perception, especially in human. We address this issue by combining data from direct cortical stimulation (DCS) for eliciting somatosensation and data from high-gamma band (HG) elicited during tactile stimulation and movement tasks. We found that artificial somatosensory perception is elicited not only from conventional somatosensory-related areas such as the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices but also from a widespread network including superior/inferior parietal lobules and premotor cortex. Interestingly, DCS on the dorsal part of the fronto-parietal area including superior parietal lobule and dorsal premotor cortex often induces movement-related somatosensations, whereas that on the ventral one including inferior parietal lobule and ventral premotor cortex generally elicits tactile sensations. Furthermore, the HG mapping results of the movement and passive tactile stimulation tasks revealed considerable similarity in the spatial distribution between the HG and DCS functional maps. Our findings showed that macroscopic neural processing for tactile and movement-related perceptions could be segregated.},

  abstract = {Diffusion weighted MRI is an indispensable tool for routine patient screening and diagnostics of pathology. Recently, several deep learning methods have been proposed to quantify diffusion parameters, but poor generalisation to new data prevents broader use of these methods, as they require retraining of the neural network for each new scan protocol. In this work, we present the dtiRIM, a new deep learning method for Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) based on the Recurrent Inference Machines. Thanks to its ability to learn how to solve inverse problems and to use the diffusion tensor model to promote data consistency, the dtiRIM can generalise to variations in the acquisition settings. This enables a single trained network to produce high quality tensor estimates for a variety of cases. We performed extensive validation of our method using simulation and in vivo data, and compared it to the Iterated Weighted Linear Least Squares (IWLLS), the approach of the state-of-the-art MRTrix3 software, and to an implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Our results show that dtiRIM predictions present low dependency on tissue properties, anatomy and scanning parameters, with results comparable to or better than both IWLLS and MLE. Further, we demonstrate that a single dtiRIM model can be used for a diversity of data sets without significant loss in quality, representing, to our knowledge, the first generalisable deep learning based solver for DTI.},

Current knowledge confirms that gross total resection highly influence survival in patient with glioma. However, surgery performed in eloquent brain area, could seriously compromise the quality of life in patient with reduced life expectancy even more if it concerns the language function. Methods: 18 right-handed patients with perisylvian gliomas on the left hemisphere were prospectively analyzed over a period of 12 months. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging based tractography of the five main language Tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus, Frontal Aslant Tract, Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus, Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, Uncinate Fasciculus) was navigated during the surgical procedure. Using a validated method, correlations were made between the pre-operative fascicles and their possible infiltration and surgical damage. The language status was assessed using the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results: In all nine patients who developed a permanent disorder there was pre-operative involvement of at least one fascicle and resection of at least one of these. In this way, areas of high risk of permanent language damage have emerged as a result of surgical injury: the temporoparietal junction, the middle portion of the FAT and the temporal stem. Conclusions: Navigated tractography has proven to be a user-friendly tool that can assess perioperative risk, guide surgical resection, and help the neurosurgeon to find that balance between tumor resection and function preservation.},

  abstract = {The anatomy and functional role of the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) remain poorly known. We accurately analyze its course and the anatomical distribution of its frontal terminations. We propose a classification of the IFOF in different subcomponents. Ten hemispheres (5 left, 5 right) were dissected with Klingler’s technique. In addition to the IFOF dissection, we performed a 4-T diffusion tensor imaging study on a single healthy subject. We identified two layers of IFOF. The first one is superficial and antero-superiorly directed, terminating in the inferior frontal gyrus. The second is deeper and consists of three portions: posterior, middle and anterior. The posterior component terminates in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. The middle component terminates in the MFG and lateral orbito-frontal cortex. The anterior one is directed to the orbito-frontal cortex and frontal pole. In vivo tractography study confirmed these anatomical findings. We suggest that the distribution of IFOF fibers within the frontal lobe corresponds to a fine functional segmentation. IFOF can be considered as a “multi-function” bundle, with each anatomical subcomponent subserving different brain processing. The superficial layer and the posterior component of the deep layer, which connects the occipital extrastriate, temporo-basal and inferior frontal cortices, might subserve semantic processing. The middle component of the deep layer could play a role in a multimodal sensory–motor integration. Finally, the anterior component of the deep layer might be involved in emotional and behavioral aspects.},

  abstract = {Objectives Although diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and postmortem dissections improved the knowledge of white matter (WM) anatomy, functional information is lacking. Our aims are: to provide a subcortical atlas of human brain functions; to elucidate the functional roles of different bundles; to provide a probabilistic resection map of WM. Experimental design We studied 130 patients who underwent awake surgery for gliomas (82 left; 48 right) with electrostimulation mapping at cortical and subcortical levels. Different aspects of language, sensori-motor, spatial cognition, and visual functions were monitored. 339 regions of interest (ROIs) including the functional response errors collected during stimulation were co-registered in the MNI space, as well as the resections’ areas and residual tumors. Functional response errors and resection areas were matched with DTI and cortical atlases. Subcortical maps for each function and a probability map of resection were computed. Principal observations The medial part of dorsal stream (arcuate fasciculus) subserves phonological processing; its lateral part [indirect anterior portion of the superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF)] subserves speech planning. The ventral stream subserves language semantics and matches with the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle. Reading deficits match with the inferior longitudinal fascicle. Anomias match with the indirect posterior portion of the SLF. Frontal WM underpins motor planning and execution. Right parietal WM subserves spatial cognition. Sensori-motor and visual fibers were the most preserved bundles. Conclusions We report the first anatomo-functional atlas of WM connectivity in humans by correlating cognitive data, electrostimulation, and DTI.

  abstract = {Whether brain networks underlying the multimodal processing of language in humans are present in non-human primates is an unresolved question in primate evolution. Conceptual awareness in humans, which is the backbone of verbal and non-verbal semantic elaboration, involves intracerebral connectivity via the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF). While non-human primates can communicate through visual information channels, there has been no formal demonstration that they possess a functional homologue of the human IFOF. Therefore, we undertook a post-mortem diffusion MRI tractography study in conjunction with Klingler micro-dissection to search for IFOF fiber tracts in brain of Old-World (vervet) monkeys. We found clear and concordant evidence from both techniques for the existence of bilateral fiber tracts connecting the frontal and occipital lobes. These tracts closely resembled the human IFOF with respect to trajectory, topological organization, and cortical terminal fields. Moreover, these fibers are clearly distinct from other bundles previously described in this region of monkey brain, i.e., the inferior longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, and the external and extreme capsules. This demonstration of an IFOF in brain of a species that diverged from the human lineage some 22~millions years ago enhances our comprehension about the evolution of language and social behavior.},

  abstract = {Segmenting the brain tumour from MRI using a tumour growth model is a developing research field because the intensity feature obtained from first scan point using Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) largely improves tumour segmentation result. However, the random selection of LBM parameters reduces the effectiveness of tumour growth model. To overcome that, the Modified Sunflower Optimization (MSFO) algorithm is hybrid along with LBM which optimally selects the parameters that maximize the performance of tumour growth model. Along with these intensity features, the texture features (fractal and multi-fractal Brownian motion (mBm)) are extracted. Before going for feature extraction, the data needs to be pre-processed. Therefore, a scalable range based adaptive bilateral filter (SCRAB) is used at the pre-processing step which removes the noise from the data and improves the edges. Finally, the extracted features are combined and provided as an input to fully resolution convolutional network (FrCN) for segmentation. The performance of the proposed approach is analysed using different metrics viz. accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Further, the error attained by proposed method is also evaluated using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Root mean square error (RMSE). Three benchmark BRATS dataset such as BRATS 2020, BRATS 2019, and BRATS 2018 are used in this work for performance analysis. The resultant values are compared with the performance of existing methods. The overall accuracy attained by proposed approach for three different datasets are 97\% (2020), 95.56\% (2019) and 95.23\% (2018) respectively.},

  abstract = {Clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was introduced in the early 1980s and has become a widely accepted and heavily utilized medical technology. This technique requires that the patients being studied be exposed to an intense magnetic field of a strength not previously encountered on a wide scale by humans. Nonetheless, the technique has proved to be very safe and the vast majority of the scans have been performed without any evidence of injury to the patient. In this article the history of proposed interactions of magnetic fields with human tissues is briefly reviewed and the predictions of electromagnetic theory on the nature and strength of these interactions are described. The physical basis of the relative weakness of these interactions is attributed to the very low magnetic susceptibility of human tissues and the lack of any substantial amount of ferromagnetic material normally occurring in these tissues. The presence of ferromagnetic foreign bodies within patients, or in the vicinity of the scanner, represents a very great hazard that must be scrupulously avoided. As technology and experience advance, ever stronger magnetic field strengths are being brought into service to improve the capabilities of this imaging technology and the benefits to patients. It is imperative that vigilance be maintained as these higher field strengths are introduced into clinical practice to assure that the high degree of patient safety that has been associated with MRI is maintained. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis), a framework for joint image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyze MR images of glioblastomas (primary brain tumors). We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we “grow a tumor” (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible. This “coupled problem” two-way couples the biophysical inversion and the registration problem. In the image registration step we solve a large-deformation diffeomorphic registration problem parameterized by an Eulerian velocity field. In the biophysical inversion step we estimate parameters in a reaction–diffusion tumor growth model that is formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE). In SIBIA, we couple these two sub-components in an iterative manner. We first presented the components of SIBIA in “Gholami et al., Framework for Scalable Biophysics-based Image Analysis, IEEE/ACM Proceedings of the SC2017” in which we derived parallel distributed memory algorithms and software modules for the decoupled registration and biophysical inverse problems. In this paper, our contributions are the introduction of a PDE-constrained optimization formulation of the coupled problem, and the derivation of a Picard iterative solution scheme. We perform extensive tests to experimentally assess the performance of our method on synthetic and clinical datasets. We demonstrate the convergence of the SIBIA optimization solver in different usage scenarios. We demonstrate that using SIBIA, we can accurately solve the coupled problem in three dimensions (256 3 resolution) in a few minutes using 11 dual-x86 nodes.},

  abstract = {The ability of diffusion MRI (dMRI) fiber tractography to non-invasively map three-dimensional (3D) anatomical networks in the human brain has made it a valuable tool in both clinical and research settings. However, there are many assumptions inherent to any tractography algorithm that can limit the accuracy of the reconstructed fiber tracts. Among them is the assumption that the diffusion-weighted images accurately reflect the underlying fiber orientation distribution (FOD) in the MRI voxel. Consequently, validating dMRI's ability to assess the underlying fiber orientation in each voxel is critical for its use as a biomedical tool. Here, using post-mortem histology and confocal microscopy, we present a method to perform histological validation of orientation functions in 3D, which has previously been limited to two-dimensional analysis of tissue sections. We demonstrate the ability to extract the 3D FOD from confocal z-stacks, and quantify the agreement between the MRI estimates of orientation information obtained using constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and the true geometry of the fibers. We find an orientation error of approximately 6° in voxels containing nearly parallel fibers, and 10-11° in crossing fiber regions, and note that CSD was unable to resolve fibers crossing at angles below 60° in our dataset. This is the first time that the 3D white matter orientation distribution is calculated from histology and compared to dMRI. Thus, this technique serves as a gold standard for dMRI validation studies - providing the ability to determine the extent to which the dMRI signal is consistent with the histological FOD, and to establish how well different dMRI models can predict the ground truth FOD.},

This “crossing fiber” problem has been estimated to affect anywhere from 30\% to as many as 90\% of white matter voxels, and it is often assumed that increasing spatial resolution will decrease the prevalence of voxels containing multiple fiber populations. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent of the crossing fiber problem as we progressively increase the spatial resolution, with the goal of determining whether it is possible to mitigate this problem with higher resolution spatial sampling. This is accomplished using ex vivo MRI data of the macaque brain, followed by histological analysis of the same specimen to validate these measurements, as well as to extend this analysis to resolutions not yet achievable in practice with MRI. In both dMRI and histology, we find unexpected results: the prevalence of crossing fibers increases as we increase spatial resolution. The problem of crossing fibers appears to be a fundamental limitation of dMRI associated with the complexity of brain tissue, rather than a technical problem that can be overcome with advances such as higher fields and stronger gradients.},

State-of-the art susceptibility correction (for example, FSL's TOPUP algorithm) typically requires data acquired twice with reverse phase encoding directions, referred to as blip-up blip-down acquisitions, in order to estimate an undistorted volume. Unfortunately, not all imaging protocols include a blip-up blip-down acquisition, and cannot take advantage of the state-of-the art susceptibility and motion correction capabilities. In this study, we aim to enable TOPUP-like processing with historical and/or limited diffusion imaging data that include only a structural image and single blip diffusion image. We utilize deep learning to synthesize an undistorted non-diffusion weighted image from the structural image, and use the non-distorted synthetic image as an anatomical target for distortion correction. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach (named Synb0-DisCo) and show that our distortion correction process results in better matching of the geometry of undistorted anatomical images, reduces variation in diffusion modeling, and is practically equivalent to having both blip-up and blip-down non-diffusion weighted images.},

  abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance images may suffer from geometric distortions due to susceptibility induced off resonance fields, which cause geometric mismatch with anatomical images and ultimately affect subsequent quantification of microstructural or connectivity indices. State-of-the art diffusion distortion correction methods typically require data acquired with reverse phase encoding directions, resulting in varying magnitudes and orientations of distortion, which allow estimation of an undistorted volume. Alternatively, additional field maps acquisitions can be used along with sequence information to determine warping fields. However, not all imaging protocols include these additional scans and cannot take advantage of state-of-the art distortion correction. To avoid additional acquisitions, structural MRI (undistorted scans) can be used as registration targets for intensity driven correction. In this study, we aim to (1) enable susceptibility distortion correction with historical and/or limited diffusion datasets that do not include specific sequences for distortion correction and (2) avoid the computationally intensive registration procedure typically required for distortion correction using structural scans. To achieve these aims, we use deep learning (3D U-nets) to synthesize an undistorted b0 image that matches geometry of structural T1w images and intensity contrasts from diffusion images. Importantly, the training dataset is heterogenous, consisting of varying acquisitions of both structural and diffusion. We apply our approach to a withheld test set and show that distortions are successfully corrected after processing. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed distortion correction and intensity-based registration against state-of-the-art distortion correction (FSL topup). The results illustrate that the proposed pipeline results in b0 images that are geometrically similar to non-distorted structural images, and more closely match state-of-the-art correction with additional acquisitions. In addition, we show generalizability of the proposed approach to datasets that were not in the original training / validation / testing datasets. These datasets included varying populations, contrasts, resolutions, and magnitudes and orientations of distortion and show efficacious distortion correction. The method is available as a Singularity container, source code, and an executable trained model to facilitate evaluation.},

  abstract = {When investigating connectivity and microstructure of white matter pathways of the brain using diffusion tractography bundle segmentation, it is important to understand potential confounds and sources of variation in the process. While cross-scanner and cross-protocol effects on diffusion microstructure measures are well described (in particular fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), it is unknown how potential sources of variation effect bundle segmentation results, which features of the bundle are most affected, where variability occurs, nor how these sources of variation depend upon the method used to reconstruct and segment bundles. In this study, we investigate six potential sources of variation, or confounds, for bundle segmentation: variation (1) across scan repeats, (2) across scanners, (3) across vendors (4) across acquisition resolution, (5) across diffusion schemes, and (6) across diffusion sensitization. We employ four different bundle segmentation workflows on two benchmark multi-subject cross-scanner and cross-protocol databases, and investigate reproducibility and biases in volume overlap, shape geometry features of fiber pathways, and microstructure features within the pathways. We find that the effects of acquisition protocol, in particular acquisition resolution, result in the lowest reproducibility of tractography and largest variation of features, followed by vendor-effects, scanner-effects, and finally diffusion scheme and b-value effects which had similar reproducibility as scan-rescan variation. However, confounds varied both across pathways and across segmentation workflows, with some bundle segmentation workflows more (or less) robust to sources of variation. Despite variability, bundle dissection is consistently able to recover the same location of pathways in the deep white matter, with variation at the gray matter/ white matter interface. Next, we show that differences due to the choice of bundle segmentation workflows are larger than any other studied confound, with low-to-moderate overlap of the same intended pathway when segmented using different methods. Finally, quantifying microstructure features within a pathway, we show that tractography adds variability over-and-above that which exists due to noise, scanner effects, and acquisition effects. Overall, these confounds need to be considered when harmonizing diffusion datasets, interpreting or combining data across sites, and when attempting to understand the successes and limitations of different methodologies in the design and development of new tractography or bundle segmentation methods.},

  abstract = {White matter bundle segmentation using diffusion MRI fiber tractography has become the method of choice to identify white matter fiber pathways in vivo in human brains. However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process.},

  abstract = {Characterizing and understanding the limitations of diffusion MRI fiber tractography is a prerequisite for methodological advances and innovations which will allow these techniques to accurately map the connections of the human brain. The so-called “crossing fiber problem” has received tremendous attention and has continuously triggered the community to develop novel approaches for disentangling distinctly oriented fiber populations. Perhaps an even greater challenge occurs when multiple white matter bundles converge within a single voxel, or throughout a single brain region, and share the same parallel orientation, before diverging and continuing towards their final cortical or sub-cortical terminations. These so-called “bottleneck” regions contribute to the ill-posed nature of the tractography process, and lead to both false positive and false negative estimated connections. Yet, as opposed to the extent of crossing fibers, a thorough characterization of bottleneck regions has not been performed. The aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence of bottleneck regions. To do this, we use diffusion tractography to segment known white matter bundles of the brain, and assign each bundle to voxels they pass through and to specific orientations within those voxels (i.e. fixels). We demonstrate that bottlenecks occur in greater than 50-70\% of fixels in the white matter of the human brain. We find that all projection, association, and commissural fibers contribute to, and are affected by, this phenomenon, and show that even regions traditionally considered “single fiber voxels” often contain multiple fiber populations. Together, this study shows that a majority of white matter presents bottlenecks for tractography which may lead to incorrect or erroneous estimates of brain connectivity or quantitative tractography (i.e., tractometry), and underscores the need for a paradigm shift in the process of tractography and bundle segmentation for studying the fiber pathways of the human brain.},

In particular, probabilistic and deterministic tracking of the dentate-rubro-thalamic tract (DRTT) and differences between the spatial courses of the DRTT and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) tract were compared. Six patients with movement disorders were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including two sets of diffusion-weighted images (12 and 64 directions). Probabilistic and deterministic tractography was applied on each diffusion-weighted dataset to delineate the DRTT. Results were compared with regard to their sensitivity in revealing the DRTT and additional fiber tracts and processing time. Two sets of regions-of-interests (ROIs) guided deterministic tractography of the DRTT or the CTC, respectively. Tract distances to an atlas-based reference target were compared. Probabilistic fiber tracking with 64 orientations detected the DRTT in all twelve hemispheres. Deterministic tracking detected the DRTT in nine (12 directions) and in only two (64 directions) hemispheres. Probabilistic tracking was more sensitive in detecting additional fibers (e.g. ansa lenticularis and medial forebrain bundle) than deterministic tracking. Probabilistic tracking lasted substantially longer than deterministic. Deterministic tracking was more sensitive in detecting the CTC than the DRTT. CTC tracts were located adjacent but consistently more posterior to DRTT tracts. These results suggest that probabilistic tracking is more sensitive and robust in detecting the DRTT but harder to implement than deterministic approaches. Although sensitivity of deterministic tracking is higher for the CTC than the DRTT, targets for DBS based on these tracts likely differ.},

We prospectively examined potential benefits of volumetry of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a new 7T scanner. Methods 20 patients with normal tension glaucoma and 16 control individuals were examined. LGN volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic tract (OT) and the optic radiation (OR) and their correlation with RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) thickness were analyzed. Results LGN volume was significantly reduced in NTG (60.9 vs 88.3; p {$<$} 0.05). FA of the OT (right: 0.35 vs 0.66, left: 0.36 vs 0.67; p {$<$} 0.05) and of the OR (right: 0.41 vs 0.70, left: 0.41 vs 0.69; p {$<$} 0.05) was also significantly reduced. Nasal RNFL thickness correlated with the volume of the contralateral LGN (r = 0.471, p = 0.05). Temporal RNFL thickness correlated with the volume of the ipsilateral LGN (r = 0.603, p = 0.015). Conclusion NTG leads to significant atrophy of the LGN compared to controls. FA of the optic tract and the optic radiation is reduced in NTG as sign of axonal degeneration. RNFL thickness but not FA correlates with LGN volume.},

We present a novel fiber orientation distribution function (ODF) based streamline tractography approach which incorporates information of neighboring regions derived from a Bayesian model. In each iteration step, the proposed algorithm defines a set of candidate fiber fragments continuing the already tracked path and assigns an a-posteriori probability. We compute the posterior as the normalized product of a likelihood function based on the given ODF-field and a prior distribution representing anatomical plausibility of a candidate fiber fragment with respect to tract curvature derived from the previously tracked fiber path by an extrapolation strategy. We derive both a deterministic tractography algorithm obtaining in each iteration a tracking direction by maximum a-posteriori estimation, as well as a probabilistic version drawing a direction from the marginalized posterior distribution. Compared to fiber tracking methods that rely only on the local ODF, the proposed algorithm proves more robust in the presence of noise and partial volume effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both our deterministic and probabilistic method on simulated, phantom, and in vivo data.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography is essential for reconstructing white-matter projections in the living human brain. Yet tractography results miss some projections and falsely identify others. A challenging example is the optic radiation (OR) that connects the thalamus and the primary visual cortex. Here, we tested whether OR tractography can be optimized using quantitative T1 mapping. Based on histology, we proposed that myelin-sensitive T1 values along the OR should remain consistently low compared with adjacent white matter. We found that complementary information from the T1 map allows for increasing the specificity of the reconstructed OR tract by eliminating falsely identified projections. This T1-filtering outperforms other, diffusion-based tractography filters. These results provide evidence that the smooth microstructural signature along the tract can be used as constructive input for tractography. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can be applied in a case of multiple sclerosis, and generalized to the HCP-available MRI measurements. We conclude that multimodal MRI microstructural information can be used to eliminate spurious tractography results in the case of the OR.},

  abstract = {Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) is a popular software pipeline to coregister sets of diffusion tensor Fractional Anisotropy (FA) images for performing voxel-wise comparisons. It is primarily defined by its skeleton projection step intended to reduce effects of local misregistration. A white matter "skeleton" is computed by morphological thinning of the inter-subject mean FA, and then all voxels are projected to the nearest location on this skeleton. Here we investigate several enhancements to the TBSS pipeline based on recent advances in registration for other modalities, principally based on groupwise registration with the ANTS-SyN algorithm. We validate these enhancements using simulation experiments with synthetically-modified images. When used with these enhancements, we discover that TBSS's skeleton projection step actually reduces algorithm accuracy, as the improved registration leaves fewer errors to warrant correction, and the effects of this projection's compromises become stronger than those of its benefits. In our experiments, our proposed pipeline without skeleton projection is more sensitive for detecting true changes and has greater specificity in resisting false positives from misregistration. We also present comparative results of the proposed and traditional methods, both with and without the skeleton projection step, on three real-life datasets: two comparing differing populations of Alzheimer's disease patients to matched controls, and one comparing progressive supranuclear palsy patients to matched controls. The proposed pipeline produces more plausible results according to each disease's pathophysiology. © 2014.},

Here, we applied a machine learning (ML) method to assess the clinical utility of dMRI metrics along corticospinal tracts (CST), investigating whether motor glioma patients can be classified with respect to their motor status. The ML-based analysis included developing models based on support vector machine (SVM) using histogram-based measures of dMRI-based tract profiles (e.g., mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness), following a recursive feature elimination (RFE) method based on SVM (SVM-RFE). Our model achieved high performance (74\% sensitivity, 75\% specificity, 74\% overall accuracy and 77\% AUC). Incorporating the patients’ demographics and clinical features such as age, tumor WHO grade, tumor location, gender and resting motor threshold (RMT) into our designed models demonstrated that these features were not as effective as microstructural measures.

Aphasia was graded preoperatively using the Aachen aphasia test (AAT). Subsequently, we created bundle segmentations based on automatically generated tract orientation mappings using TractSeg. To prepare the input for the support vector machine (SVM), we first preselected aphasia-related fiber bundles based on the associations between relative tract volumes and AAT subtests. In addition, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)-based metrics [axial diffusivity (AD), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD)] were extracted within the fiber bundles' masks with their mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness values. Our model consisted of random forest-based feature selection followed by an SVM. The best model performance achieved 81\% accuracy (specificity\,=\,85\%, sensitivity\,=\,73\%, and AUC\,=\,85\%) using dMRI-based features, demographics, tumor WHO grade, tumor location, and relative tract volumes. The most effective features resulted from the arcuate fasciculus (AF), middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). The most effective dMRI-based metrics were FA, ADC, and AD. We achieved a prediction of aphasia using dMRI-based features and demonstrated that AF, IFOF, and MLF were the most important fiber bundles for predicting aphasia in this cohort.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI streamlines tractography suffers from a number of inherent limitations, one of which is the accurate determination of when streamlines should be terminated. Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as "Anatomically-Constrained Tractography". Results indicate that some of the known false positives associated with tractography algorithms are prevented, such that the biological accuracy of the reconstructions should be improved, provided that state-of-the-art streamlines tractography methods are used. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI allows the structural connectivity of the whole brain (the 'tractogram') to be estimated in vivo non-invasively using streamline tractography. The biological accuracy of these data sets is however limited by the inherent biases associated with the reconstruction method. Here we propose a method to retrospectively improve the accuracy of these reconstructions, by selectively filtering out streamlines from the tractogram in a manner that improves the fit between the streamline reconstruction and the underlying diffusion images. This filtering is guided by the results of spherical deconvolution of the diffusion signal, hence the acronym SIFT: spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms. Data sets processed by this algorithm show a marked reduction in known reconstruction biases, and improved biological plausibility. Emerging methods in diffusion MRI, particularly those that aim to characterise and compare the structural connectivity of the brain, should benefit from the improved accuracy of the reconstruction. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {White matter connections enable the interaction within and between brain networks. Brain lesions can cause structural disconnections that disrupt networks and thereby cognitive functions supported by them. In recent years, novel methods have been developed to quantify the extent of structural disconnection after focal lesions, using tractography data from healthy controls. These methods, however, are indirect and their reliability and validity have yet to be fully established. In this study, we present our implementation of this approach, in a tool supplemented by uncertainty metrics for the predictions overall and at voxel-level. These metrics give an indication of the reliability and are used to compare predictions with direct measures from patients' diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data in a sample of 95 first-ever stroke patients. Results show that, except for small lesions, the tool can predict fiber loss with high reliability and compares well to direct patient DTI estimates. Clinical utility of the method was demonstrated using lesion data from a subset of patients suffering from hemianopia. Both tract-based measures outperformed lesion localization in mapping visual field defects and showed a network consistent with the known anatomy of the visual system. This study offers an important contribution to the validation of structural disconnection mapping. We show that indirect measures of structural disconnection can be a reliable and valid substitute for direct estimations of fiber loss after focal lesions. Moreover, based on these results, we argue that indirect structural disconnection measures may even be preferable to lower-quality single subject diffusion MRI when based on high-quality healthy control datasets.},

  abstract = {Patients with functionally eloquent brain lesions are at risk of functional decline in the course of resection. Given tumor-related plastic reshaping and reallocation of function, individual data are needed for patient counseling and risk assessment prior to surgery. This study evaluates the utility of mapping by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for individual risk evaluation of surgery-related decline of motor or language function in the clinical setting. In total, 250 preoperative nTMS mappings (100 language and 150 motor mappings) derived from 216 patients (mean age: 57.0 ± 15.5 years, 58.8\% males; glioma World Health Organization (WHO) grade I \& II: 4.2\%, glioma WHO grade III \& IV: 83.4\%, arteriovenous malformations: 1.9\%, cavernoma: 2.3\%, metastasis: 8.2\%) were included. Deterministic tractography based on nTMS motor or language maps as seed regions was performed with 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% of the individual fractional anisotropy threshold (FAT). Lesion-to-tract distances (LTDs) were measured between the tumor mass and the corticospinal tract (CST), arcuate fascicle (AF), or other closest language-related tracts. LTDs were compared between patients and correlated to the functional status (no/transient/permanent surgery-related paresis or aphasia). Significant differences were found between patients with no or transient surgery-related deficits and patients with permanent surgery-related deficits regarding LTDs in relation to the CST (p {$<$} 0.0001), AF (p ≤ 0.0491), or other closest language-related tracts (p ≤ 0.0435). The cut-off values for surgery-related paresis or aphasia were ≤ 12 mm (LTD—CST) and ≤ 16 mm (LTD—AF) or ≤25 mm (LTD—other closest language-related tract), respectively. Moreover, there were significant associations between the status of surgery-related deficits and the LTD when considering the CST (range r: −0.3994 to −0.3910, p {$<$} 0.0001) or AF (range r: −0.2918 to −0.2592, p = 0.0135 and p = 0.0473 for 25\% and 50\% FAT). In conclusion, this is the largest study evaluating the application of both preoperative functional mapping and function-based tractography for motor and language function for risk stratification in patients with functionally eloquent tumors. The LTD may qualify as a viable marker that can be seamlessly assessed in the clinical neurooncological setup.},

  abstract = {Complicated molecular and cellular processes take place in a spatiotemporally heterogeneous and precisely regulated pattern in the human fetal brain, yielding not only dramatic morphological and microstructural changes, but also macroscale connectomic transitions. As the underlying substrate of the fetal brain structural network, both dynamic neuronal migration pathways and rapid developing fetal white matter (WM) fibers could fundamentally reshape early fetal brain connectome. Quantifying structural connectome development can not only shed light on the brain reconfiguration in this critical yet rarely studied developmental period, but also reveal alterations of the connectome under neuropathological conditions. However, transition of the structural connectome from the mid-fetal stage to birth is not yet known. The contribution of different types of neural fibers to the structural network in the mid-fetal brain is not known, either. In this study, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) of 10 fetal brain specimens at the age of 20 postmenstrual weeks (PMW), 12 in vivo brains at 35 PMW, and 12 in vivo brains at term (40 PMW) were acquired. The structural connectome of each brain was established with evenly parcellated cortical regions as network nodes and traced fiber pathways based on DTI tractography as network edges. Two groups of fibers were categorized based on the fiber terminal locations in the cerebral wall in the 20 PMW fetal brains. We found that fetal brain networks become stronger and more efficient during 20-40 PMW. Furthermore, network strength and global efficiency increase more rapidly during 20-35 PMW than during 35-40 PMW. Visualization of the whole brain fiber distribution by the lengths suggested that the network reconfiguration in this developmental period could be associated with a significant increase of major long association WM fibers. In addition, non-WM neural fibers could be a major contributor to the structural network configuration at 20 PMW and small-world network organization could exist as early as 20 PMW. These findings offer a preliminary record of the fetal brain structural connectome maturation from the middle fetal stage to birth and reveal the critical role of non-WM neural fibers in structural network configuration in the middle fetal stage.},

An important first step toward understanding the function of such a network is to map its elements and connections, to create a comprehensive structural description of the network architecture. This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small-world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

  abstract = {Malignant glioma surgery involves the challenge of preserving the neurological status of patients harboring these lesions while pursuing a maximal tumor resection, which is correlated with overall and progression-free survival. Presently, several tools exist for assisting neurosurgeons in visualizing malignant tissue. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has increasingly been used during the last decade for identifying malignant glioma. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI), first introduced in the mid-1990s, is being evaluated as a further tool to maximize the extent of resection. We aimed to evaluate the literature and discuss synergies and differences between FGS with 5-ALA and iMRI. We conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. After excluding non-relevant articles, 16 articles were evaluated and included in the qualitative analysis, comprising 2 (n = 2) reviews of the literatures, 1 (n = 1) book chapter, and 13 (n = 13) clinical articles. ALA-induced fluorescence goes beyond the borders of gadolinium contrast enhancement. Several studies stress the synergy between both tools, enabling increase in extent of resection. We point out advantages of combining both methods. iMRI, however, is not widely available, is expensive, and is not recommended as sole resection control tool in high-grade glio-ma. For these centers, FGS together with mapping and monitoring techniques, neuronavigation and, when needed, intraop-erative ultrasound provides an excellent setting for achieving state-of-the-art gross total resection of high-grade gliomas.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging white matter tractography, an increasingly popular preoperative planning modality used for pre-surgical planning in brain tumor patients, is employed with the goal of maximizing tumor resection while sparing postoperative neurological function. Clinical translation of white matter tractography has been limited by several shortcomings of standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), including poor modeling of fibers crossing through regions of peritumoral edema and low spatial resolution for typical clinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) sequences. Track density imaging (TDI) is a post-tractography technique that uses the number of tractography streamlines and their long-range continuity to map the white matter connections of the brain with enhanced image resolution relative to the acquired dMRI data, potentially offering improved white matter visualization in patients with brain tumors. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of TDI-based white matter maps in a neurosurgical planning context compared to the current clinical standard of DTI-based white matter maps. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive brain tumor patients from a single institution were retrospectively selected for the study. Each patient underwent 3-Tesla dMRI scanning with 30 gradient directions and a b-value of 1000~s/mm2. For each patient, two directionally encoded color (DEC) maps were produced as follows. DTI-based DEC-fractional anisotropy maps (DEC-FA) were generated on the scanner, while DEC-track density images (DEC-TDI) were generated using constrained spherical deconvolution based tractography. The potential clinical utility of each map was assessed by five practicing neurosurgeons, who rated the maps according to four clinical utility statements regarding different clinical aspects of pre-surgical planning. The neurosurgeons rated each map according to their agreement with four clinical utility statements regarding if the map 1 identified clinically relevant tracts, (2) helped establish a goal resection margin, (3) influenced a planned surgical route, and (4) was useful overall. Cumulative link mixed effect modeling and analysis of variance were performed to test the primary effect of map type (DEC-TDI vs. DEC-FA) on rater score. Pairwise comparisons using estimated marginal means were then calculated to determine the magnitude and directionality of differences in rater scores by map type. RESULTS: A majority of rater responses agreed with the four clinical utility statements, indicating that neurosurgeons found both DEC maps to be useful. Across all four investigated clinical utility statements, the DEC map type significantly influenced rater score. Rater scores were significantly higher for DEC-TDI maps compared to DEC-FA maps. The largest effect size in rater scores in favor of DEC-TDI maps was observed for clinical utility statement 2, which assessed establishing a goal resection margin. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant neurosurgeon preference for DEC-TDI maps, indicating their potential utility for neurosurgical planning.},

Improvements in dMRI tractography algorithms, which reconstruct macroscopic three-dimensional white matter fiber pathways, have allowed for methodological advances in the study of white matter; however, insufficient attention has been paid to comparing post-tractography methods that extract white matter fiber tracts of interest from whole-brain tractography. Here we conduct a comparison of three representative and conceptually distinct approaches to fiber tract delineation: 1) a manual multiple region of interest-based approach, 2) an atlas-based approach, and 3) a groupwise fiber clustering approach, by employing methods that exemplify these approaches to delineate the arcuate fasciculus, the middle longitudinal fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus in 10 healthy male subjects. We enable qualitative comparisons across methods, conduct quantitative evaluations of tract volume, tract length, mean fractional anisotropy, and true positive and true negative rates, and report measures of intra-method and inter-method agreement. We discuss methodological similarities and differences between the three approaches and the major advantages and drawbacks of each, and review research and clinical contexts for which each method may be most apposite. Emphasis is given to the means by which different white matter fiber tract delineation approaches may systematically produce variable results, despite utilizing the same input tractography and reliance on similar anatomical knowledge.},

The cortico-spinal tract (CST) belongs to one of the most often delineated tracts preoperatively, although the optimal DTI method has not been established yet. Considering that various regions of interests (ROIs) could be selected, the reproducibility of CST tracking among different centres is low. We aimed to select the most reliable tractography method for outlining the CST for neurosurgeons. Materials and methods: Our prospective study consisted of 32 patients (11 males, 21 females) with a brain tumour of various locations. DTI and T1-weighed image series were acquired prior to the surgery. To draw the CST, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and the cerebral peduncle (CP) were defined as two main ROIs. Together with these main ROIs, another four cortical endpoints were selected: The frontal lobe (FL), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the precentral gyrus (PCG) and the postcentral gyrus (POCG). Based on these ROIs, we composed ten virtual CSTs in DSI Studio. The fractional anisotropy, the mean diffusivity, the tracts' volume, the length and the number were compared between all the CSTs. The degree of the CST infiltration, tumour size, the patients' sex and age were examined. Results: Significant differences in the number of tracts and their volume were observed when the PLIC or the CP stood as a single ROI comparing with the two- ROI method (all p {$<$} 0.05). The mean CST volume was 40054U (SD ± 12874) and the number of fibres was 259.3 (SD ± 87.3) when the PLIC was a single ROI. When the CP was a single ROI, almost a half of fibres (147.6; SD ± 64.0) and half of the CST volume (26664U; SD ± 10059U) was obtained (all p {$<$} 0.05). There were no differences between the various CSTs in terms of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, the apparent diffusion coefficient, radial diffusivity and the tract length (p {$>$} 0.05). The CST was infiltrated by a growing tumour or oedema in 17 of 32 patients; in these cases, the mean and apparent diffusion of the infiltrated CST was significantly higher than in uncompromised CSTs (p = 0.04). CST infiltration did not alter the other analysed parameters (all p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions: A universal method of DTI of the CST was not developed. However, we found that the CP or the PLIC (with or without FL as the second ROI) should be used to outline the CST.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To perform a retrospective, quantitative assessment of the anatomic relationship between intra-axial, supratentorial, primary brain tumors, and adjacent white matter fiber tracts based on anatomic and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We hypothesized that white matter infiltration may be common among different types of tumor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Preoperative, anatomic (T1- and T2-weighted), and LINESCAN diffusion tensor MRI were obtained in 12 patients harboring supratentorial gliomas (World Health Organization [WHO] Grades II and III). The two imaging modalities were rigidly registered. The tumors were manually segmented from the T1- and T2-weighted MRI, and their volume calculated. A three-dimensional tractography was performed in each case. A second segmentation and volume measurement was performed on the tumor regions intersecting adjacent white matter fiber tracts. Statistical methods included summary statistics to examine the fraction of tumor volume infiltrating adjacent white matter. RESULTS: There were five patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade II), one with low-grade mixed oligoastrocytoma (WHO Grade II), one with ganglioglioma, two with low-grade astrocytoma (WHO Grade II), and three with anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III). We identified white matter tracts infiltrated by tumor in all 12 cases. The median tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) in our patient population was 42.5 +/- 28.9 mL. The median tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) infiltrating white matter fiber tracts was 5.2 +/- 9.9 mL. The median percentage of tumor volume infiltrating white matter fiber tracts was 21.4\% +/- 9.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: The information provided by diffusion tensor imaging combined with anatomic MRI might be useful for neurosurgical planning and intraoperative guidance. Our results confirm previous reports that extensive white matter infiltration by primary brain tumors is a common occurrence. However, prospective, large population studies are required to definitively clarify this issue, and how infiltration relates to histologic tumor type, tumor size, and location.},

In particular, we quantified along-tract diffusion parameters and AF spatial distribution evaluating hemispheric asymmetries in a group of healthy subjects. Methods: The AF was bilaterally reconstructed in a group of 29 healthy subjects using the probabilistic ball-and-sticks model, and both deterministic and probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution. We chose cortical ROIs as tractography targets and the developed along-tract algorithm used the Laplacian operator to parameterize the volume of the tract, allowing along-tract analysis and tract curvature mapping independent of the tractography algorithm used. Results: The Laplacian parameterization successfully described the tract geometry underlying hemispheric asymmetries in the AF curvature. Using the probabilistic tractography methods, we found more tracts branching towards cortical terminations in the left hemisphere. This influenced the left AF curvature and its diffusion parameters, which were significantly different with respect to the right. In particular, we detected projections towards the middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri bilaterally, and towards the superior temporal and precentral gyri in the left hemisphere, with a significantly increased volume and connectivity. Conclusions: The approach we propose is useful to evaluate brain asymmetries, assessing the volume, the diffusion properties and the quantitative spatial localization of the AF.},

However, little is known about the association of white matter fibers with the processing of these object categories. In the current study we used DTI-based tractography to reconstruct two main fibers that connect the occipital lobe with the anterior temporal lobe (inferior longitudinal fasciculus-ILF) and with the frontal lobe (inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus-IFOF) in normal individuals. In addition to MRI scans subjects performed face, scene and body recognition tasks outside the scanner. Results show that recognition of faces and scenes were selectively associated with separate parts of the ILF. In particular, face recognition was highly associated with the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the anterior part of the ILF in the right hemisphere. In contrast, scene recognition was strongly correlated with the FA of the posterior and middle but not the anterior part of the ILF bilaterally. Our findings provide the first demonstration that faces and places are not only associated with distinct brain areas but also with separate parts of white matter fibers.},

Delanuany triangulation is then used to obtain bin perimeters for each grid point, which results in a network of bins that are evenly distributed across the entire globe and have uniform area. A modified winding rule is used to determine which datapoints are in which bin. This binning method is especially suited to remote sensing applications involving datasets covering polar regions, where conventional rectangular latitude/longitude bins introduce distortion and streaking into the binned data if noise is present. It also has the property that adjacent bins overlap, providing Nyquist sampling and preventing spatial aliasing.

  abstract = {The graph theoretical analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has received a great deal of interest in recent years to characterize the organizational principles of brain networks and their alterations in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the characterization of networks in clinical populations can be challenging, since the comparison of connectivity between groups is influenced by several factors, such as the overall number of connections and the structural abnormalities of the seed regions. To overcome these limitations, the current study employed the whole-brain analysis of connectional fingerprints in diffusion tensor imaging data obtained at 3 T of chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 16) and healthy, age-matched control participants (n = 17). Probabilistic tractography was performed to quantify the connectivity of 110 brain areas. The connectional fingerprint of a brain area represents the set of relative connection probabilities to all its target areas and is, hence, less affected by overall white and gray matter changes than absolute connectivity measures. After detecting brain regions with abnormal connectional fingerprints through similarity measures, we tested each of its relative connection probability between groups. We found altered connectional fingerprints in schizophrenia patients consistent with a dysconnectivity syndrome. While the medial frontal gyrus showed only reduced connectivity, the connectional fingerprints of the inferior frontal gyrus and the putamen mainly contained relatively increased connection probabilities to areas in the frontal, limbic, and subcortical areas. These findings are in line with previous studies that reported abnormalities in striatal-frontal circuits in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, highlighting the potential utility of connectional fingerprints for the analysis of anatomical networks in the disorder.},

Its accuracy is known to be limited by technical factors affecting in vivo data acquisition, such as noise, artifacts, and data undersampling resulting from scan time constraints. It generally is assumed that improvements in data quality and implementation of sophisticated tractography methods will lead to increasingly accurate maps of human anatomical connections. However, assessing the anatomical accuracy of DWI tractography is difficult because of the lack of independent knowledge of the true anatomical connections in humans. Here we investigate the future prospects of DWI-based connectional imaging by applying advanced tractography methods to an ex vivo DWI dataset of the macaque brain. The results of different tractography methods were compared with maps of known axonal projections from previous tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the exceptional quality of the DWI data, none of the methods demonstrated high anatomical accuracy. The methods that showed the highest sensitivity showed the lowest specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the tractography algorithm, with different optimal values for mapping different pathways. These results suggest that there is an inherent limitation in determining long-range anatomical projections based on voxelaveraged estimates of local fiber orientation obtained from DWI data that is unlikely to be overcome by improvements in data acquisition and analysis alone.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Tractography derived from diffusion MRI can provide important insights into human brain microstructure in vivo. Neurosurgeons were quick to adopt the technique at the turn of the century, but it remains plagued by technical fallibilities. This study aims to describe how tractography is deployed clinically in a modern-day, public healthcare system, serving as a snapshot from the ‘shop floor’ of British neurosurgical practice. Methods: An 11-question survey was circulated to the mailing lists of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and British Neurosurgical Trainees’ Association, including questions on frequency, indication, tracts reconstructed, specific details of techniques used and personnel by whom it was performed, and a free-text section on the limitations of tractography. Results: 58 survey responses were received, covering all 40 neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland. Overall, responses were received from neurosurgeons at 36 units (90.0\%) stating tractography was in use at that unit. 74.1\% of the responses were from Consultants. The most common indication for tractography was in tumour resection. It was most commonly performed by neuroradiologists or imaging scientists. 75.9\% of respondents stated that the model used to process tractography was the diffusion tensor (DTI). Many respondents were unaware of which algorithm (74.1\%) or software tools (65.6\%) were used by the operator to produce tractography visualisations. The corticospinal tract was the most commonly reconstructed tract. The most commonly cited limitations of the technique were perceived inaccuracy and brain shift. Conclusions: In this UK-based survey of practising neurosurgeons, we show that 90\% of neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland use tractography regularly; that predominantly DTI-based reconstructions are used; that tumour resection remains the most frequent use of the technique; and that large tracts such as the corticospinal tract are most frequently identified. Many neurosurgeons remain unfamiliar with the underlying methods used to produce tractography visualisations.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging can provide information related to the arrangement of white matter fibers. The diffusion tensor is the model most commonly used to derive the orientation of the fibers within a voxel. However, this model has been shown to fail in regions containing several fiber populations with distinct orientations. A number of alternative models have been suggested, such as multiple tensor fitting, q-space, and Q-ball imaging. However, each of these has inherent limitations. In this study, we propose a novel method for estimating the fiber orientation distribution directly from high angular resolution diffusion-weighted MR data without the need for prior assumptions regarding the number of fiber populations present. We assume that all white matter fiber bundles in the brain share identical diffusion characteristics, thus implicitly assigning any differences in diffusion anisotropy to partial volume effects. The diffusion-weighted signal attenuation measured over the surface of a sphere can then be expressed as the convolution over the sphere of a response function (the diffusion-weighted attenuation profile for a typical fiber bundle) with the fiber orientation density function (ODF). The fiber ODF (the distribution of fiber orientations within the voxel) can therefore be obtained using spherical deconvolution. The properties of the technique are demonstrated using simulations and on data acquired from a volunteer using a standard 1.5-T clinical scanner. The technique can recover the fiber ODF in regions of multiple fiber crossing and holds promise for applications such as tractography. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible.

  abstract = {The probabilistic streamlines [1] approach is one of the most promising methods to perform diffusion-weighted tractography. It takes into consideration the inherent noisy nature of DW data, extends naturally to allow fibre tracking through regions containing crossing fibres, and can be implemented to be relatively fast. However, current implementations of this algorithm work by stepping along an orientation derived from the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) at the current point only, and can hence be viewed as first order integration methods. Such methods are known to ‘overshoot’, and this effect has indeed previously been reported for the deterministic streamlines algorithm [2]. Higher order (Runge-Kutta) integration methods have been proposed to improve the quality of tracking results obtained using tensor-based deterministic streamlines [3], but unfortunately these are not suitable for probabilistic multi-fibre fibre- tracking applications. In this study, we propose a novel higher order probabilistic streamlines method, based on 2nd order integration over fibre orientation distributions (iFOD2).},

  abstract = {In recent years, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has attracted considerable attention due to its unique potential to delineate the white matter pathways of the brain. However, methodologies currently available and in common use among neuroscientists and clinicians are typically based on the diffusion tensor model, which has comprehensively been shown to be inadequate to characterize diffusion in brain white matter. This is due to the fact that it is only capable of resolving a single fiber orientation per voxel, causing incorrect fiber orientations, and hence pathways, to be estimated through these voxels. Given that the proportion of affected voxels has been recently estimated at 90\%, this is a serious limitation. Furthermore, most implementations use simple "deterministic" streamlines tracking algorithms, which have now been superseded by "probabilistic" approaches. In this study, we present a robust set of tools to perform tractography, using fiber orientations estimated using the validated constrained spherical deconvolution method, coupled with a probabilistic streamlines tracking algorithm. This methodology is shown to provide superior delineations of a number of known white matter tracts, in a manner robust to crossing fiber effects. These tools have been compiled into a software package, called MRtrix, which has been made freely available for use by the scientific community. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, the optimal b value and number of diffusion-weighted (DW) directions for HARDI are still undetermined, primarily as a result of the large number of available reconstruction methods and corresponding parameters, making it impossible to identify a single criterion by which to assess performance. In this study, we estimate the minimum number of DW directions and optimal b values required for HARDI by focusing on the angular frequency content of the DW signal itself. The spherical harmonic (SH) series provides the spherical analogue of the Fourier series, and can hence be used to examine the angular frequency content of the DW signal. Using high-quality data acquired along 500 directions over a range of b values, we estimate that SH terms above l=8 are negligible in practice for b values up to 5000s/mm2, implying that a minimum of 45 DW directions is sufficient to fully characterise the DW signal. l{$>$}0 SH terms were found to increase as a function of b value, levelling off at b=3000s/mm2, suggesting that this value already provides the highest achievable angular resolution. In practice, it is recommended to acquire more than the minimum of 45 DW directions to avoid issues with imperfections in the uniformity of the DW gradient directions and to meet signal-to-noise requirements of the intended reconstruction method. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction algorithm are discussed.},

  abstract = {Microsurgical resection of primary brain tumors located within or near eloquent areas is challenging. Primary aim is to preserve neurological function, while maximizing the extent of resection (EOR), to optimize long-term neurooncological outcomes and quality of life. Here, we review the combined integration of awake craniotomy and intraoperative MRI (IoMRI) for primary brain tumors, due to their multiple challenges. A systematic review of the literature was performed, in accordance with the Prisma guidelines. Were included 13 series and a total number of 527 patients, who underwent 541 surgeries. We paid particular attention to operative time, rate of intraoperative seizures, rate of initial complete resection at the time of first IoMRI, the final complete gross total resection (GTR, complete radiological resection rates), and the immediate and definitive postoperative neurological complications. The mean duration of surgery was 6.3 h (median 7.05, range 3.8–7.9). The intraoperative seizure rate was 3.7\% (range 1.4–6; I\^2 = 0\%, P heterogeneity = 0.569, standard error = 0.012, p = 0.002). The intraoperative complete resection rate at the time of first IoMRI was 35.2\% (range 25.7–44.7; I\^2 = 66.73\%, P heterogeneity = 0.004, standard error = 0.048, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of patients who underwent supplementary resection after one or several IoMRI was 46\% (range 39.8–52.2; I\^2 = 8.49\%, P heterogeneity = 0.364, standard error = 0.032, p {$<$} 0.001). The GTR rate at discharge was 56.3\% (range 47.5–65.1; I\^2 = 60.19\%, P heterogeneity = 0.01, standard error = 0.045, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of immediate postoperative complications was 27.4\% (range 15.2–39.6; I\^2 = 92.62\%, P heterogeneity {$<$} 0.001, standard error = 0.062, p {$<$} 0.001). The rate of permanent postoperative complications was 4.1\% (range 1.3–6.9; I\^2 = 38.52\%, P heterogeneity = 0.123, standard error = 0.014, p = 0.004). Combined use of awake craniotomy and IoMRI can help in maximizing brain tumor resection in selected patients. The technical obstacles to doing so are not severe and can be managed by experienced neurosurgery and anesthesiology teams. The benefits of bringing these technologies to bear on patients with brain tumors in or near language areas are obvious. The lack of equipoise on this topic by experienced practitioners will make it difficult to do a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. In the opinion of the authors, such a trial would be unnecessary and would deprive some patients of the benefits of the best available methods for their tumor resections.},

  abstract = {Advancements in imaging protocols such as the high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI) and in tractography techniques are expected to cause an increase in the tract-based analyses. Statistical analyses over white matter tracts can contribute greatly towards understanding structural mechanisms of the brain since tracts are representative of connectivity pathways. The main challenge with tract-based studies is the extraction of the tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of individuals without drawing the inclusion and exclusion regions of interest. In this work, we design a framework for automated extraction of white matter tracts. The framework introduces three main components, namely a connectivity based fiber representation, a fiber bundle atlas, and a clustering approach called Adaptive Clustering. The fiber representation relies on the connectivity signatures of fibers to establish an easy correspondence between different subjects. A group-wise clustering of these fibers that are represented by the connectivity signatures is then used to generate a fiber bundle atlas. Finally, Adaptive Clustering incorporates the previously generated clustering atlas as a prior, to cluster the fibers of a new subject automatically. Experiments on the HARDI scans of healthy individuals acquired repeatedly, demonstrate the applicability, reliability and the repeatability of our approach in extracting white matter tracts. By alleviating the seed region selection and the inclusion/exclusion ROI drawing requirements that are usually handled by trained radiologists, the proposed framework expands the range of possible clinical applications and establishes the ability to perform tract-based analyses with large samples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in white matter tractography enhance neurosurgical planning and glioma resection, but white matter tractography is limited by biological variables such as edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration or selection biases related to regions of interest or fractional anisotropy values. OBJECTIVE: To provide an automated tract identification paradigm that corrects for artifacts created by tumor edema and infiltration and provides a consistent, accurate method of fiber bundle identification. METHODS: An automated tract identification paradigm was developed and evaluated for glioma surgery. A fiber bundle atlas was generated from 6 healthy participants. Fibers of a test set (including 3 healthy participants and 10 patients with brain tumors) were clustered adaptively with this atlas. Reliability of the identified tracts in both groups was assessed by comparison with 2 experts with the Cohen used to quantify concurrence. We evaluated 6 major fiber bundles: cingulum bundle, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the last 3 tracts mediating language function. RESULTS: The automated paradigm demonstrated a reliable and practical method to identify white mater tracts, despite mass effect, edema, and tract infiltration. When the tumor demonstrated significant mass effect or shift, the automated approach was useful for providing an initialization to guide the expert with identification of the specific tract of interest. CONCLUSION: We report a reliable paradigm for the automated identification of white matter pathways in patients with gliomas. This approach should enhance the neurosurgical objective of maximal safe resections.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that expanding glioblastomas typically induce significant deformations of the surrounding parenchyma (i.e., the so-called 'mass effect'). In this study, we evaluate the performance of three mathematical models of tumor growth: 1) a reaction-diffusion-advection model which accounts for mass effect (RDAM), 2) a reaction-diffusion model with mass effect that is consistent only in the case of small deformations (RDM), and 3) a reaction-diffusion model that does not include the mass effect (RD). The models were calibrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained during tumor development in a murine model of glioma (n = 9). We obtained \textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{\textbackslash it T\}2\}-weighted and contrast-enhanced \textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{\textbackslash it T\}1\}-weighted MRI at 6 time points over 10 days to determine the spatiotemporal variation in the mass effect and the volume fraction of tumor cells, respectively. We calibrated the three models using data 1) at the first four, 2) only at the first and fourth, and 3) only at the third and fourth time points. Each of these calibrations were run forward in time to predict the volume fraction of tumor cells at the conclusion of the experiment. The diffusion coefficient for the RDAM model (median of 10.65 × 10\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-3\}\} mm\textbackslash boldsymbol\{2\textbackslash cdot \} d\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-1\}\}) is significantly less than those for the RD and RDM models (17.46 × 10\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-3\}\} mm\textbackslash boldsymbol\{2\textbackslash cdot \} d\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-1\}\} and 19.38 × 10\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-3\}\} mm\textbackslash boldsymbol\{2\textbackslash cdot \} d\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\{-1\}\}, respectively). The error in the tumor volume fraction for the RD, RDM, and RDAM models have medians of 40.2\%, 32.1\%, and 44.7\%, respectively, for the calibration using data from the first four time points. The RDM model most accurately predicts tumor growth, while the RDAM model presents the least variation in its estimates of the diffusion coefficient and proliferation rate. This study demonstrates that the mathematical models capture both tumor development and mass effect observed in experiments.},

  abstract = {Objectives Injury to major white matter pathways during language-area associated glioma surgery often leads to permanent loss of neurological function. The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. Methods We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3~months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. Results In 14 out of 50 patients (28\%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3~months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc~=~0.314; p~=~0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 – 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 – 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia. Conclusions Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               Surgical resection of gliomas involving the supplementary motor area (SMA) frequently results in SMA syndrome, a symptom complex characterized by transient akinesia and mutism. Because the factors influencing patient functional outcomes after surgery remain elusive, the authors investigated network-based predictors in a multicentric cohort of glioma patients.                                         METHODS               The participants were 50 patients treated for glioma located in the SMA at one of the three centers participating in the study. Postoperative functional outcomes (motor deficits, mutism) and duration of symptoms were assessed during hospitalization. Long-term outcome was assessed 3 months after surgery. MRI-based lesion-symptom mapping was performed to estimate the severity of gray matter damage and white matter disconnection.                                         RESULTS               The median duration of acute symptoms was 3 days (range 1–42 days). Long-term deficits involving fine motor movements and speech were found at follow-up in 27 patients (54\%). Disconnection of the central callosal fibers was associated with prolonged acute symptoms (p {$<$} 0.05). Postoperative mutism was significantly related to disconnection severity of the left frontopontine tract, frontal aslant tract, cingulum, and corticostriatal tract (p {$<$} 0.05). Disconnection of midposterior callosal fibers and lesion loads within the left medial Brodmann area 4 were associated with long-term motor deficits (p {$<$} 0.05).                                         CONCLUSIONS               This study provides evidence for the pathophysiology and predictive factors of postoperative SMA syndrome by demonstrating the relation of the disconnection of callosal fibers with prolonged symptom duration (central segment) and long-term motor deficits (midposterior segment). These data may be useful for presurgical risk assessment and adequate consultation for patients prior to undergoing resection of glioma located within the SMA region.},

  abstract = {The recently established single-shot technique of echo-planar imaging of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) for determining and imaging the variations of microscopic motions of water has been applied to studies of water perfusion in phantoms and to in vivo studies of diffusion and perfusion in cat and human brains. The phantom results demonstrate that perfusion levels comparable with those found in vivo have easily observable and reproducible effects on signal amplitude that are consistent with previous IVIM theory. Reliable measurements of the diffusion coefficient in various types of brain tissue have been obtained. The results for white matter are consistent with the existence of anisotropic diffusion in oriented bundles of myelinated nerve fibers. The results for gray matter can be fitted to the IVIM theory and suggest a value of up to 14\% for the fraction of the signal contributed by randomly perfusing fluid in normal cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {Diffeomorphic mappings are central to image registration due largely to their topological properties and success in providing biologically plausible solutions to deformation and morphological estimation problems. Popular diffeomorphic image registration algorithms include those characterized by time-varying and constant velocity fields, and symmetrical considerations. Prior information in the form of regularization is used to enforce transform plausibility taking the form of physics-based constraints or through some approximation thereof, e.g., Gaussian smoothing of the vector fields [a la Thirion's Demons (Thirion, 1998)]. In the context of the original Demons' framework, the so-called directly manipulated free-form deformation (DMFFD) (Tustison et al., 2009) can be viewed as a smoothing alternative in which explicit regularization is achieved through fast B-spline approximation. This characterization can be used to provide B-spline "flavored" diffeomorphic image registration solutions with several advantages. Implementation is open source and available through the Insight Toolkit and our Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository. A thorough comparative evaluation with the well-known SyN algorithm (Avants et al., 2008), implemented within the same framework, and its B-spline analog is performed using open labeled brain data and open source evaluation tools. © 2013 Tustison and Avants.},

  abstract = {Tumor growth models have the potential to model and predict the spatiotemporal evolution of glioma in individual patients. Infiltration of glioma cells is known to be faster along the white matter tracts, and therefore structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to inform the model. However, applying and evaluating growth models in real patient data is challenging. In this work, we propose to formulate the problem of tumor growth as a ranking problem, as opposed to a segmentation problem, and use the average precision (AP) as a performance metric. This enables an evaluation of the spatial pattern that does not require a volume cut-off value. Using the AP metric, we evaluate diffusion-proliferation models informed by structural MRI and DTI, after tumor resection. We applied the models to a unique longitudinal dataset of 14 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG), who received no treatment after surgical resection, to predict the recurrent tumor shape after tumor resection. The diffusion models informed by structural MRI and DTI showed a small but significant increase in predictive performance with respect to homogeneous isotropic diffusion, and the DTI-informed model reached the best predictive performance. We conclude there is a significant improvement in the prediction of the recurrent tumor shape when using a DTI-informed anisotropic diffusion model with respect to istropic diffusion, and that the AP is a suitable metric to evaluate these models.

  abstract = {Purpose: To compare two techniques to assess corticospinal tract (CST) damage in stroke patients: tract-specific analysis by probabilistic tractography and segmentation using a CST template. Materials and Methods: We extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) values, the FA ratio, and mean diffusivity (MD) in 18 stroke patients and 21 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. We compared the two methods in order to determine their ability to detect 1) differences between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters of healthy volunteers and stroke patients, 2) the correlation between DTI parameters and clinical scores, and 3) the correlation between DTI parameters and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals in a fist-closure task. Results: FA values were higher with the tractography approach than with the segmentation method, but differences between the ipsilesional CST and the homologous region in healthy subjects were detected using both methods. In patients, clinical scores were significantly correlated with FA values and FA ratios with both methods. The BOLD signal was positively correlated with FA values for CST with the segmentation but not with the tractography approach. Conclusion: CST damage in stroke patients can be assessed by either probabilistic tractography or segmentation of a CST template. Although each method has advantages and limitations, both are sensitive enough to detect differences among stroke patients and identify specific correlations with clinical scores. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Current navigation systems do not accurately account for intraoperative brain deformation. So far, most studies of brain deformation have focused on brain shift, whereas this paper focuses on the brain deformation due to retraction. The heart of our system is a 3D nonrigid registration technique using a biomechanical model driven by the deformations of key surfaces tracked between two intraoperative images. The key surfaces, e.g., the whole-brain region boundary and the lips of the retraction cut, thus deform due to the combination of gravity and retractor deployment. The tissue discontinuity due to retraction is handled via the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which has the appealing feature of being able to handle arbitrarily shaped discontinuity without any remeshing. Our approach is shown to significantly improve the alignment of intraoperative MRI.},

  abstract = {To summarize the distribution of glioma location within a patient population, registration of individual MR images to anatomical reference space is required. In this study, we quantified the accuracy of MR image registration to anatomical reference space with linear and non-linear transformations using estimated tumor targets of glioblastoma and lower-grade glioma, and anatomical landmarks at pre- and post-operative time-points using six commonly used registration packages (FSL, SPM5, DARTEL, ANTs, Elastix, and NiftyReg). Routine clinical pre- and post-operative, post-contrast T1-weighted images of 20 patients with glioblastoma and 20 with lower-grade glioma were collected. The 2009a Montreal Neurological Institute brain template was used as anatomical reference space. Tumors were manually segmented in the patient space and corresponding healthy tissue was delineated as a target volume in the anatomical reference space. Accuracy of the tumor alignment was quantified using the Dice score and the Hausdorff distance. To measure the accuracy of general brain alignment, anatomical landmarks were placed in patient and in anatomical reference space, and the landmark distance after registration was quantified. Lower-grade gliomas were registered more accurately than glioblastoma. Registration accuracy for pre- and post-operative MR images did not differ. SPM5 and DARTEL registered tumors most accurate, and FSL least accurate. Non-linear transformations resulted in more accurate general brain alignment than linear transformations, but tumor alignment was similar between linear and non-linear transformation. We conclude that linear transformation suffices to summarize glioma locations in anatomical reference space.},

Optimising this balance remains hindered by our still limited understanding of information processing in the human brain. To help understand individual differences in functional outcomes following neuro-oncological treatment, we review mounting evidence demonstrating the fundamental role that white matter connections play in complex human behaviour. We focus on selected fibre tracts whose destruction is recognised to elicit predictable behavioural deficits and consider specific indications for non-invasive diffusion MRI tractography, the only existing method to map these fibre tracts in vivo, in the selection and planning of neuro-oncological treatments.

  abstract = {Introduction: Despite evidence of correspondence with intraoperative stimulation, there remains limited data on MRI diffusion tractography (DT)’s sensitivity to predict morbidity after neurosurgical oncology treatment. Our aims were: (1) evaluate DT against subcortical stimulation mapping and performance changes during and after awake neurosurgery; (2) evaluate utility of early post-operative DT to predict recovery from post-surgical deficits. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our first 100 awake neurosurgery procedures using DT- neuronavigation. Intra-operative stimulation and performance outcomes were assessed to classify DT predictions for sensitivity and specificity calculations. Post-operative DT data, available in 51 patients, were inspected for tract damage. Results: 91 adult brain tumor patients (mean 49.2~years, 43 women) underwent 100 awake surgeries with subcortical stimulation between 2014 and 2019. Sensitivity and specificity of pre-operative DT predictions were 92.2\% and 69.2\%, varying among tracts. Post-operative deficits occurred after 41 procedures (39\%), but were prolonged ({$>$} 3~months) in only 4 patients (4\%). Post-operative DT in general confirmed surgical preservation of tracts. Post-operative DT anticipated complete recovery in a patient with supplementary motor area syndrome, and indicated infarct-related damage to corticospinal fibers associated with delayed, partial recovery in a second patient. Conclusions: Pre-operative DT provided very accurate predictions of the spatial location of tracts in relation to a tumor. As expected, however, the presence of a tract did not inform its functional status, resulting in variable DT specificity among individual tracts.

  abstract = {Intraoperatively acquired diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in cranial tumor surgery are used for early detection of ischemic brain injuries, which could result in impaired neurological outcome and their presence might thus influence the neurosurgeon’s decision on further resection. The phenomenon of false-negative DWI findings in intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) has only been reported in single cases and therefore yet needs to be further analyzed. This retrospective single-center study’s objective was the identification and characterization of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI with new or enlarged ischemic areas on postoperative MRI (poMRI). Out of 225 cranial tumor surgeries with intraoperative DWI sequences, 16 cases with no additional resection after ioMRI and available in-time poMRI ({$<$} 14 days) were identified. Of these, a total of 12 cases showed false-negative DWI in ioMRI (75\%). The most frequent tumor types were oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (4 each). In 5/12 cases (41.7\%), an ischemic area was already present in ioMRI, however, volumetrically increased in poMRI (mean infarct growth + 2.1 cm 3 ; 0.48–3.6), whereas 7 cases (58.3\%) harbored totally new infarcts on poMRI (mean infarct volume 0.77 cm 3 ; 0.05–1.93). With this study we provide the most comprehensive series of false-negative DWI findings in ioMRI that were not followed by additional resection. Our study underlines the limitations of intraoperative DWI sequences for the detection and size-estimation of hyperacute infarction. The awareness of this phenomenon is crucial for any neurosurgeon utilizing ioMRI.},

The method use a priori model of tumor growth assuming that the tumor grows in a radial way from a starting point. First, an affine transformation is used in order to bring the patient image and the brain atlas in a global correspondence. Second, the seeding of a synthetic tumor into the brain atlas provides a template for the lesion. Finally, the seeded atlas is deformed combining a method derived from optical flow principles and a model for tumor growth (MTG).

Commonly used unwarping methods require the acquisition of supplementary images during the scanning session. Alternatively, distortions can be corrected by nonlinear registration to a non-EPI acquired structural image. In this study, we compared reliability using two methods of unwarping: (1) nonlinear registration to a structural image using symmetric normalization (SyN) implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs); and (2) unwarping using an acquired field map. We performed this comparison in two different test-retest data sets acquired at differing sites (N = 39 and N = 32). In both data sets, nonlinear registration provided higher test-retest reliability of the output fractional anisotropy (FA) maps than field map-based unwarping, even when accounting for the effect of interpolation on the smoothness of the images. In general, field map-based unwarping was preferable if and only if the field maps were acquired optimally.},

  abstract = {The posterior visual pathway is commonly affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology that results in measurable clinical and electrophysiological impairment. Due to its highly structured retinotopic mapping, the visual pathway represents an ideal substrate for investigating patho-mechanisms in MS. Therefore, a reliable and robust imaging segmentation method for in-vivo delineation of the optic radiations (OR) is needed. However, diffusion-based tractography approaches, which are typically used for OR segmentation are confounded by the presence of focal white matter lesions. Current solutions require complex acquisition paradigms and demand expert image analysis, limiting application in both clinical trials and clinical practice. In the current study, using data acquired in a clinical setting on a 3T scanner, we optimised and compared two approaches for optic radiation (OR) reconstruction: individual probabilistic tractography-based and template-based methods. OR segmentation results were applied to subjects with MS and volumetric and diffusivity parameters were compared between OR segmentation techniques. Despite differences in reconstructed OR volumes, both OR lesion volume and OR diffusivity measurements in MS subjects were highly comparable using optimised probabilistic tractography-based, and template-based, methods. The choice of OR reconstruction technique should be determined primarily by the research question and the nature of the available dataset. Template-based approaches are particularly suited to the semi-automated analysis of large image datasets and have utility even in the absence of dMRI acquisitions. Individual tractography methods, while more complex than template based OR reconstruction, permit measurement of diffusivity changes along fibre bundles that are affected by specific MS lesions or other focal pathologies.

  abstract = {Purpose To provide a comprehensive understanding of multi-shot EPI diffusion imaging methods by comparing Readout segmented EPI (RS-EPI) and interleaved EPI (iEPI). Materials and methods RS-EPI and iEPI were compared on the same 3T scanner. A 2D navigator was used for both RS-EPI and iEPI for phase correction. Signal to noise ratio (SNR), fractional anisotropy (FA) and distortion level were compared using phantom data. Distortion reduction capability and scan efficiency were compared with different protocols with simulations. In addition, distortion reduction capability and diffusion tensor imaging performance were compared using in vivo data. Results Our phantom data showed that the mean SNRs were 50.5, 86.6 and 45.4 for RS-EPI using GRAPPA=3, fully sampled iEPI and iEPI using GRAPPA=2 respectively. The mean FA values were 0.08, 0.05 and 0.09 for RS-EPI using GRAPPA=3, fully sampled iEPI and iEPI using GRAPPA=2 respectively. The distortion levels were 1.34mm, 1.29mm and 0.61mm for RS-EPI using GRAPPA=3, fully sampled iEPI and iEPI using GRAPPA=2 respectively. The effective echo spacing could be reduced by increasing the number of shots for both methods but more prominent for iEPI. The scan time was approximately proportional to the number of shots for both methods and RS-EPI showed a shorter scan time. Our in vivo data for distortion comparison showed consistent results with the effective echo spacing study. The mean difference of the FA and MD values between the high resolution sequences and SS-EPI was all within 7\%. Conclusion For high resolution diffusion imaging, iEPI has more potential in distortion reduction than RS-EPI when increasing the number of shots. RS-EPI can achieve a reasonable SNR with a shorter scan time than iEPI. RS-EPI and iEPI have similar performance in FA and MD quantifications as well as showing structure details when using eleven shots for in vivo diffusion tensor imaging.},

  abstract = {Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from medical images is important for clinical assessment and treatment planning of brain tumors. Recent years have seen an increasing use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task, but most of them use either 2D networks with relatively low memory requirement while ignoring 3D context, or 3D networks exploiting 3D features while with large memory consumption. In addition, existing methods rarely provide uncertainty information associated with the segmentation result. We propose a cascade of CNNs to segment brain tumors with hierarchical subregions from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance images (MRI), and introduce a 2.5D network that is a trade-off between memory consumption, model complexity and receptive field. In addition, we employ test-time augmentation to achieve improved segmentation accuracy, which also provides voxel-wise and structure-wise uncertainty information of the segmentation result. Experiments with BraTS 2017 dataset showed that our cascaded framework with 2.5D CNNs was one of the top performing methods (second-rank) for the BraTS challenge. We also validated our method with BraTS 2018 dataset and found that test-time augmentation improves brain tumor segmentation accuracy and that the resulting uncertainty information can indicate potential mis-segmentations and help to improve segmentation accuracy.},

However, the functional relevance and significance of WM BOLD signals remain controversial. Here we investigated whether 7T BOLD fMRI can reveal fine-scale functional organizations of a WM bundle. Population receptive field (pRF) analyses of the 7T retinotopy dataset from the Human Connectome Project revealed clear contralateral retinotopic organizations of two visual WM bundles: the optic radiation (OR) and the vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). The retinotopic maps of OR are highly consistent with post-mortem dissections and diffusion tractographies, while the VOF maps are compatible with the dorsal and ventral visual areas connected by the WM. Similar to the grey matter (GM) visual areas, both WM bundles show over-representations of the central visual field and increasing pRF size with eccentricity. Hemodynamic response functions of visual WM were slower and wider compared with those of GM areas. These findings clearly demonstrate that WM BOLD at 7 Tesla is closely coupled with neural activity related to axons, encoding highly specific information that can be used to characterize fine-scale functional organizations of a WM bundle.},

  abstract = {During neurosurgical procedures the objective of the neurosurgeon is to achieve the resection of as much diseased tissue as possible while achieving the preservation of healthy brain tissue. The restricted capacity of the conventional operating room to enable the surgeon to visualize critical healthy brain structures and tumor margin has lead, over the past decade, to the development of sophisticated intraoperative imaging techniques to enhance visualization. However, both rigid motion due to patient placement and nonrigid deformations occurring as a consequence of the surgical intervention disrupt the correspondence between preoperative data used to plan surgery and the intraoperative configuration of the patient's brain. Similar challenges are faced in other interventional therapies, such as in cryoablation of the liver, or biopsy of the prostate. We have developed algorithms to model the motion of key anatomical structures and system implementations that enable us to estimate the deformation of the critical anatomy from sequences of volumetric images and to prepare updated fused visualizations of preoperative and intraoperative images at a rate compatible with surgical decision making. This paper reviews the experience at Brigham and Women's Hospital through the process of developing and applying novel algorithms for capturing intraoperative deformations in support of image guided therapy.},

Further, our method simplifies the quantification and statistical analysis of white matter tracts on large diffusion MRI databases. This work reflects the careful syntactical definition of major white matter fiber tracts in the human brain based on a neuroanatomist’s expert knowledge. The framework is based on a novel query language with a near-to-English textual syntax. This query language makes it possible to construct a dictionary of anatomical definitions that describe white matter tracts. The definitions include adjacent gray and white matter regions, and rules for spatial relations. This novel method makes it possible to automatically label white matter anatomy across subjects. After describing this method, we provide an example of its implementation where we encode anatomical knowledge in human white matter for ten association and 15 projection tracts per hemisphere, along with seven commissural tracts. Importantly, this novel method is comparable in accuracy to manual labeling. Finally, we present results applying this method to create a white matter atlas from 77 healthy subjects, and we use this atlas in a small proof-of-concept study to detect changes in association tracts that characterize schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The individual course of white matter fiber tracts is an important factor for analysis of white matter characteristics in healthy and diseased brains. Diffusion-weighted MRI tractography in combination with region-based or clustering-based selection of streamlines is a unique combination of tools which enables the in-vivo delineation and analysis of anatomically well-known tracts. This, however, currently requires complex, computationally intensive processing pipelines which take a lot of time to set up. TractSeg is a novel convolutional neural network-based approach that directly segments tracts in the field of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks without using tractography, image registration or parcellation. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is much faster than existing methods while providing unprecedented accuracy, using a population of 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We also show initial evidence that TractSeg is able to generalize to differently acquired data sets for most of the bundles.

Tract orientation mapping (TOM) is a novel concept that facilitates bundle-specific tractography based on a learned mapping from the original fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks to a list of tract orientation maps (also abbr. TOM). Each TOM represents one of the known tracts with each voxel containing no more than one orientation vector. TOMs can act as a prior or even as direct input for tractography. We use an encoder-decoder fully-convolutional neural network architecture to learn the required mapping. In comparison to previous concepts for the reconstruction of specific bundles, the presented one avoids various cumbersome processing steps like whole brain tractography, atlas registration or clustering. We compare it to four state of the art bundle recognition methods on 20 different bundles in a total of 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Results are anatomically convincing even for difficult tracts, while reaching low angular errors, unprecedented runtimes and top accuracy values (Dice). Our code and our data are openly available.},

  abstract = {While the major white matter tracts are of great interest to numerous studies in neuroscience and medicine, their manual dissection in larger cohorts from diffusion MRI tractograms is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge and is hard to reproduce. In previous work we presented tract orientation mapping (TOM) as a novel concept for bundle-specific tractography. It is based on a learned mapping from the original fiber orientation distribution function (FOD) peaks to tract specific peaks, called tract orientation maps. Each tract orientation map represents the voxel-wise principal orientation of one tract. Here, we present an extension of this approach that combines TOM with accurate segmentations of the tract outline and its start and end region. We also introduce a custom probabilistic tracking algorithm that samples from a Gaussian distribution with fixed standard deviation centered on each peak thus enabling more complete trackings on the tract orientation maps than deterministic tracking. These extensions enable the automatic creation of bundle-specific tractograms with previously unseen accuracy. We show for 72 different bundles on high quality, low quality and phantom data that our approach runs faster and produces more accurate bundle-specific tractograms than 7 state of the art benchmark methods while avoiding cumbersome processing steps like whole brain tractography, non-linear registration, clustering or manual dissection. Moreover, we show on 17 datasets that our approach generalizes well to datasets acquired with different scanners and settings as well as with pathologies.

  abstract = {Methods are presented to map complex fiber architectures in tissues by imaging the 3D spectra of tissue water diffusion with MR. First, theoretical considerations show why and under what conditions diffusion contrast is positive. Using this result, spin displacement spectra that are conventionally phase-encoded can be accurately reconstructed by a Fourier transform of the measured signal's modulus. Second, studies of in vitro and in vivo samples demonstrate correspondence between the orientational maxima of the diffusion spectrum and those of the fiber orientation density at each location. In specimens with complex muscular tissue, such as the tongue, diffusion spectrum images show characteristic local heterogeneities of fiber architectures, including angular dispersion and intersection. Cerebral diffusion spectra acquired in normal human subjects resolve known white matter tracts and tract intersections. Finally, the relation between the presented model-free imaging technique and other available diffusion MRI schemes is discussed. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {MRI tractography is the mapping of neural fiber pathways based on diffusion MRI of tissue diffusion anisotropy. Tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) cannot directly image multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. To address this limitation, diffusion spectrum MRI (DSI) and related methods were developed to image complex distributions of intravoxel fiber orientation. Here we demonstrate that tractography based on DSI has the capacity to image crossing fibers in neural tissue. DSI was performed in formalin-fixed brains of adult macaque and in the brains of healthy human subjects. Fiber tract solutions were constructed by a streamline procedure, following directions of maximum diffusion at every point, and analyzed in an interactive visualization environment (TrackVis). We report that DSI tractography accurately shows the known anatomic fiber crossings in optic chiasm, centrum semiovale, and brainstem; fiber intersections in gray matter, including cerebellar folia and the caudate nucleus; and radial fiber architecture in cerebral cortex. In contrast, none of these examples of fiber crossing and complex structure was identified by DTI analysis of the same data sets. These findings indicate that DSI tractography is able to image crossing fibers in neural tissue, an essential step toward non-invasive imaging of connectional neuroanatomy. © 2008.},

  abstract = {The brain hemispheres can be divided into an upper dorsal and a lower ventral system. Each system consists of distinct cortical regions connected via long association tracts. The tracts cross the central sulcus or the limen insulae to connect the frontal lobe with the posterior brain. The dorsal stream is associated with sensorimotor mapping. The ventral stream serves structural analysis and semantics in different domains, as visual, acoustic or space processing. How does the prefrontal cortex, regarded as the platform for the highest level of integration, incorporate information from these different domains? In the current view, the ventral pathway consists of several separate tracts, related to different modalities. Originally the assumption was that the ventral path is a continuum, covering all modalities. The latter would imply a very different anatomical basis for cognitive and clinical models of processing. To further define the ventral connections, we used cutting-edge in vivo global tractography on high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 100 normal subjects from the human connectome project and ex vivo preparation of fiber bundles in the extreme capsule of 8 humans using the Klingler technique. Our data showed that ventral stream tracts, traversing through the extreme capsule, form a continuous band of fibers that fan out anteriorly to the prefrontal cortex, and posteriorly to temporal, occipital and parietal cortical regions. Introduction of additional volumes of interest in temporal and occipital lobes differentiated between the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) and uncinate fascicle (UF). Unequivocally, in both experiments, in all subjects a connection between the inferior frontal and middle-to-posterior temporal cortical region, otherwise known as the temporo-frontal extreme capsule fascicle (ECF) from nonhuman primate brain-tracing experiments was identified. In the human brain, this tract connects the language domains of “Broca's area” and “Wernicke's area”. The differentiation in the three tracts, IFOF, UF and ECF seems arbitrary, all three pass through the extreme capsule. Our data show that the ventral pathway represents a continuum. The three tracts merge seamlessly and streamlines showed considerable overlap in their anterior and posterior course. Terminal maps identified prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobe and association cortex in temporal, occipital and parietal lobes as streamline endings. This anatomical substrate potentially facilitates the prefrontal cortex to integrate information across different domains and modalities.},

Intrascan and InterScan intensity inhomogeneities are a common source of difficulty. While reported methods have had some success in correcting intrascan inhomogeneities, such methods require supervision for the individual scan. This paper describes a new method called adaptive segmentation that uses knowledge of tissue intensity properties and intensity inhomogeneities to correct and segment MR images. Use of the expectation-maximization (F.M) algorithm leads to a method that allows for more accurate segmentation of tissue types as well as better visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, that has proven to be effective in a study that includes more than 1000 brain scans. Implementation and results are described for segmenting the brain in the following types of images: axial (dual-echo spin-echo), coronal [three dimensional Fourier transform (3-DFT) gradient-echo Tl-weighted] all using a conventional head coil, and a sagittal section acquired using a surface coil. The accuracy of adaptive segmentation was found to be comparable with manual segmentation, and closer to manual segmentation than supervised multivariant classification while segmenting gray and white matter, © 1996 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background: Tractography has become a standard technique for planning neurosurgical operations in the past decades. This technique relies on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The cutoff value for the fractional anisotropy (FA) has an important role in avoiding false-positive and false-negative results. However, there is a wide variation in FA cutoff values. Methods: We analyzed a prospective cohort of 14 patients (six males and eight females, 50.1 ± 4.0 years old) with intracerebral tumors that were mostly gliomas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained within 7 days before and within 7 days after surgery with T1 and diffusion tensor image (DTI) sequences. We, then, reconstructed the corticospinal tract (CST) in all patients and extracted the FA values within the resulting volume. Results: The mean FA in all CSTs was 0.4406 ± 0.0003 with the fifth percentile at 0.1454. FA values in right-hemispheric CSTs were lower (p \&lt; 0.0001). Postoperatively, the FA values were more condensed around their mean (p \&lt; 0.0001). The analysis of infiltrated or compressed CSTs revealed a lower fifth percentile (0.1407 ± 0.0109 versus 0.1763 ± 0.0040, p = 0.0036). Conclusion: An FA cutoff value of 0.15 appears to be reasonable for neurosurgical patients and may shorten the tractography workflow. However, infiltrated fiber bundles must trigger vigilance and may require lower cutoffs.},

Simulated and in vivo data are shown. The simulations demonstrate that a change in "radial" diffusivity can cause a fictitious change in "axial" diffusivity and vice versa in voxels characterized by crossing fibers. The in vivo data compare the direction of the principle eigenvector in four different subjects, two healthy and two affected by multiple sclerosis, and show that the angle, α, between the principal eigenvectors of corresponding voxels of registered datasets is greater than 45° in areas of low anisotropy, severe pathology, and partial volume. Also, there are areas of white matter pathology where the "radial" diffusivity is 10\% greater than that of the corresponding normal tissue and where the direction of the principal eigenvector is altered by more than 45° compared to the healthy case. This should strongly discourage researchers from interpreting changes of the "axial" and "radial" diffusivities on the basis of the underlying tissue structure, unless accompanied by a thorough investigation of their mathematical and geometrical properties in each dataset studied. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) is an effective treatment for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy but may result in a contralateral superior visual field deficit (VFD) that precludes driving in the seizure-free patient. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography can delineate the optic radiation preoperatively and stratify risk. It would be advantageous to incorporate display of tracts into interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide surgery. METHODS: We studied 20 patients undergoing ATLR. Structural MRI scans, DTI, and visual fields were acquired before and 3 to 12 months following surgery. Tractography of the optic radiation was performed on preoperative images and propagated onto postoperative images. The anteroposterior extent of the damage to Meyer's loop was determined, and visual loss was quantified using Goldmann perimetry. RESULTS: Twelve patients (60\%) suffered a VFD (10-92\% of upper quadrant; median, 39\%). Image registration took {$<$} 3 minutes and predicted that Meyer's loop was 4.4 to 18.7mm anterior to the resection margin in these patients, but 0.0 to 17.6mm behind the resection margin in the 8 patients without VFD. The extent of damage to Meyer's loop significantly correlated with the degree of VFD and explained 65\% of the variance in this measure. INTERPRETATION: The optic radiation can be accurately delineated by tractography and propagated onto postoperative images. The technique is fast enough to propagate accurate preoperative tractography onto intraoperative scans acquired during neurosurgery, with the potential to reduce the risk of VFD.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether display of optic radiation tractography during anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can reduce the severity of postoperative visual field deficits (VFD) and increase the proportion of patients who can drive and whether correction for brain shift using intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is beneficial. METHODS: A cohort of 21 patients underwent ATLR in an iMRI suite. Preoperative tractography of the optic radiation was displayed on the navigation and operating microscope displays either without (9 patients) or with (12 patients) correction for brain shift. VFD were quantified using Goldmann perimetry and eligibility to drive was assessed by binocular Esterman perimetry 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes included seizure freedom and extent of hippocampal resection. The comparator was a cohort of 44 patients who underwent ATLR without iMRI. RESULTS: The VFD in the contralateral superior quadrant were significantly less (p = 0.043) with iMRI guidance (0\%-49.2\%, median 14.5\%) than without (0\%-90.9\%, median 24.0\%). No patient in the iMRI cohort developed a VFD that precluded driving whereas 13\% of the non-iMRI cohort failed to meet UK driving criteria. Outcome did not differ between iMRI guidance with and without brain shift correction. Seizure outcome and degree of hippocampal resection were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Display of the optic radiation with image guidance reduces the severity of VFD and did not affect seizure outcome or hippocampal resection. Correction for brain shift is possible but did not further improve outcome. Future work to incorporate tractography into conventional neuronavigation systems will make the work more widely applicable. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.},

  abstract = {The definitive structure and functional role of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) are still controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the connectivity, asymmetry, and segmentation patterns of this bundle. High angular diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) analysis was performed on 10 healthy adults and a 90-subject DSI template (NTU-90 Atlas). In addition, a new tractography approach based on the anatomic subregions and two regions of interest (ROI) was evaluated for the fiber reconstructions. More widespread anterior-posterior connections than previous “standard” definition of the IFOF were found. This distinct pathway demonstrated a greater inter-subjects connective variability with a maximum of 40\% overlap in its central part. The statistical results revealed no asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres and no significant differences existed in distributions of the IFOF according to sex. In addition, five subcomponents within the IFOF were identified according to the frontal areas of originations. As the subcomponents passed through the anterior floor of the external capsule, the fibers radiated to the posterior terminations. The most common connection patterns of the subcomponents were as follows: IFOF-I, from frontal polar cortex to occipital pole, inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe, and pericalcarine; IFOF-II, from orbito-frontal cortex to occipital pole, inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe, and pericalcarine; IFOF-III, from inferior frontal gyrus to inferior occipital lobe, middle occipital lobe, superior occipital lobe, occipital pole, and pericalcarine; IFOF-IV, from middle frontal gyrus to occipital pole, and inferior occipital lobe; IFOF-V, from superior frontal gyrus to occipital pole, inferior occipital lobe, and middle occipital lobe. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of high resolution diffusion tensor tractography with sufficient sensitivity to elucidate more anatomical details of the IFOF. And we provides a new framework for subdividing the IFOF for better understanding its functional role in the human brain.},

Single-shot echo-planar imaging is currently the predominant formation method for diffusion MRI, but suffers from blurring, distortion, and low spatial resolution. A number of methods have been proposed to address these limitations and improve diffusion MRI acquisition. Here, the recent technical developments for image formation in diffusion MRI are reviewed.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In brain tumor surgeries, maximum removal of cancerous tissue without compromising normal brain functions can improve the patient's survival rate and therapeutic benefits. To achieve this, diffusion MRI and intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) can be highly instrumental. While diffusion MRI allows the visualization of white matter tracts and helps define the resection plan to best preserve the eloquent areas, iUS can effectively track the brain shift after craniotomy that often renders the pre-surgical plan invalid, ensuring the accuracy and safety of the intervention. Unfortunately, brain shift correction using iUS and automatic registration has never been shown for brain tractography so far despite its rising significance in brain tumor resection. METHODS: We employed a correlation-ratio-based nonlinear registration algorithm to account for brain shift through MRI-iUS registration and used the recovered deformations to warp both the brain anatomy and tractography seen in pre-surgical plans. The overall technique was demonstrated retrospectively on four patients who underwent iUS-guided low-grade brain gliomas resection. RESULTS: Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, the preoperative MRI and iUS scans were well realigned after nonlinear registration, and the deformed brain tumor volumes and white matter tracts showed large displacements away from the pre-surgical plans. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to demonstrate the technique to track nonlinear deformation of brain tractography using real clinical MRI and iUS data, and the results confirm the need for updating white matter tracts due to tissue shift during surgery.},

Brain shift can move the surgical targets and other vital structures such as blood vessels, thus invalidating the pre-surgical plan. Intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) is a convenient and cost-effective imaging tool to track brain shift and tumor resection. Accurate image registration techniques that update pre-surgical MRI based on iUS are crucial but challenging. The MICCAI Challenge 2018 for Correction of Brain shift with Intra-Operative UltraSound (CuRIOUS2018) provided a public platform to benchmark MRI-iUS registration algorithms on newly released clinical datasets. In this work, we present the data, setup, evaluation, and results of CuRIOUS 2018, which received 6 fully automated algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms were first trained with the public RESECT database, and then ranked based on test dataset of 10 additional cases with identical data curation and annotation protocols as the RESECT database. The article compares the results of all participating teams and discusses the insights gained from the challenge, as well as future work.},

  abstract = {The segmentation of cranial nerves (CNs) tracts based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a valuable quantitative tool for the analysis of the morphology and course of individual CNs. Tractography-based approaches can describe and analyze the anatomical area of CNs by selecting the reference streamlines in combination with ROIs-based (regions-of-interests) or clustering-based. However, due to the slender structure of CNs and the complex anatomical environment, single-modality data based on dMRI cannot provide a complete and accurate description, resulting in low accuracy or even failure of current algorithms in performing individualized CNs segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal deep-learning-based multi-class network for automated cranial nerves tract segmentation without using tractography, ROI placement or clustering, called CNTSeg. Specifically, we introduced T1w images, fractional anisotropy (FA) images, and fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks into the training data set, and design the back-end fusion module which uses the complementary information of the interphase feature fusion to improve the segmentation performance. CNTSeg has achieved the segmentation of 5 pairs of CNs (i.e. optic nerve CN II, oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V, and facial–vestibulocochlear nerve CN VII/VIII). Extensive comparisons and ablation experiments show promising results and are anatomically convincing even for difficult tracts.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed the pathological and imaging data of 61 patients with GBM confirmed by surgery and pathology. Moreover, the levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue samples obtained from the patients were quantified through immunohistochemical staining and evaluated with respect to overall survival. The patients were divided into the high and low CD8 expression groups. Preoperative T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1C) histogram parameters of patients with GBM were extracted using Firevoxel software. We investigated the correlation between the histogram feature parameters and CD8+ T cells. We performed statistical analyses of the T1C histogram parameters in both groups and identified characteristic parameters with significant between-group differences. Additionally, we performed a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to determine the predictive utility of these parameters. Results The levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were positively associated with overall survival in patients with GBM (P~=~0.0156). Among the T1C histogram features, the mean, 5th, 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles were negatively correlated with the levels of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the coefficient of variation (CV) was positively correlated with the levels of CD8+ T cells (all P~{$<~$}0.05). There was a significant between-group difference in the CV, 1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles (all p~{$<~$}0.05). The ROC curve analysis revealed that the CV had the highest AUC value (0.783; 95\% confidence interval: 0.658–0.878), with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.784 and 0.750, respectively, for distinguishing between the groups. Conclusions The preoperative T1C histogram have additional value for the levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with GBM.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that enables in vivo mapping of the brain’s white matter connections. White matter parcellation classifies tractography streamlines into clusters or anatomically meaningful tracts. It enables quantification and visualization of whole-brain tractography. Currently, most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), whereas fewer methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We propose a novel two-stage deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis (SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is adapted to our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers for SWM. We train our model on a large-scale tractography dataset including streamline samples from labeled long- and medium-range (over 40~mm) SWM clusters and anatomically implausible streamline samples, and we perform testing on six independently acquired datasets of different ages and health conditions (including neonates and patients with space-occupying brain tumors). Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA obtains highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation results on all datasets, showing good generalization across the lifespan in health and disease. In addition, the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.},

The geometric feature is derived from the structural geometry of diffusion and characterizes the shape of the tensor in terms of prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector of geometric feature for matching. The orientation feature improves the matching of the WM fiber tracts by taking into account the statistical information of underlying fiber orientations. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a diffusion tensor image registration algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain DT data establish the superiority of this algorithm for deformable matching of diffusion tensors, thereby aiding in atlas creation. The robustness of the method makes it potentially useful for group-based analysis of DT images acquired in large studies to identify disease-induced and developmental changes.},

  abstract = {Previous regional-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies focused on impairment of the arcuate fasciculus in aphasia; little is known about the extent to which aphasia severity is affected by damage to both ventral and dorsal language white matter (WM) pathways. To understand whether disconnection of these pathways contributes to clinical symptoms, we assessed the relationship between the alterations of WM integrity and clinical characteristics in acute aphasia after stroke. Eighteen patients with acute aphasia and age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent language assessment and DTI scanning. The whole brain unbiased tract-based spatial statistics method was employed to quantitate WM integrity (fractional anisotropy) for both groups. Linear correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between WM integrity and clinical features. The aphasic patients showed decreased WM integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus/inferior longitudinal fasciculus (IFOF/ILF) and the left uncinate fasciculus, which represents components of ventral language pathway, and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), which relates to dorsal language pathway. In addition, WM integrity of the left IFOF and SLF showed a positive correlation with aphasia quotient, performance quotient, and cortical quotient, respectively. These findings suggested that impaired WM integrity in both language pathways not only contributed to language performance, but also to general cognitive status. We suggest that aphasia involves a breakdown of multiple connections of dorsal and ventral streams that directly contributes to language deficits. Damage to these dual-streams may serve as a neuromarker for aphasias after stroke.},

  abstract = {Background: Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus. Purpose: We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements. Methods: Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer's loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks. Results: Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70-0.99; DSC = 0.84-0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82-0.99) than lesional OR (0.70-0.99). The non-lesional OR's mean volume was 22.66 cm3; the mean Meyer's loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00-3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively. Conclusion: The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.

  abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography is currently the only imaging technique that allows for non-invasive delineation and visualisation of white matter (WM) tracts in vivo, prompting rapid advances in related fields of brain MRI research in recent years. One of its major clinical applications is for pre-surgical planning and intraoperative image guidance in neurosurgery, where knowledge about the location of WM tracts nearby the surgical target can be helpful to guide surgical resection and optimise post-surgical outcomes. Surgical injuries to these WM tracts can lead to permanent neurological and functional deficits, making the accuracy of tractography reconstructions paramount. The quality of dMRI tractography is influenced by many modifiable factors, ranging from MRI data acquisition through to the post-processing of tractography output, with the potential of error propagation based on decisions made at each and subsequent processing steps. Research over the last 25 years has significantly improved the anatomical accuracy of tractography. An updated review about tractography methodology in the context of neurosurgery is now timely given the thriving research activities in dMRI, to ensure more appropriate applications in the clinical neurosurgical realm. This article aims to review the dMRI physics, and tractography methodologies, highlighting recent advances to provide the key concepts of tractography-informed neurosurgery, with a focus on the general considerations, the current state of practice, technical challenges, potential advances, and future demands to this field.},

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of EPI distortion correction using 27 legacy intraoperative HARDI datasets over two consecutive surgical time points, acquired without reverse phase-encoded data, from 17 children who underwent epilepsy surgery at our institution. The data was processed with EPI distortion correction using the Synb0-Disco technique (Schilling et al., 2019) and without distortion correction. The corrected and uncorrected b0 diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were first compared visually. The mutual information indices between the original T1-weighted images and the fractional anisotropy images derived from corrected and uncorrected DWI were used to quantify the effect of distortion correction. Sixty-four white matter tracts were segmented from each dataset, using a deep-learning based automated tractography algorithm for the purpose of a standardized and unbiased evaluation. Displacement was calculated between tracts generated before and after distortion correction. The tracts were grouped based on their principal morphological orientations to investigate whether the effects of EPI distortion vary with tract orientation. Group differences in tract distortion were investigated both globally, and regionally with respect to proximity to the resecting lesion in the operative hemisphere. Qualitatively, we observed notable improvement in the corrected diffusion images, over the typically affected brain regions near skull-base air sinuses, and correction of additional distortion unique to intraoperative open cranium images, particularly over the resection site. This improvement was supported quantitatively, as mutual information indices between the FA and T1-weighted images were significantly greater after the correction, compared to before the correction. Maximum tract displacement between the corrected and uncorrected data, was in the range of 7.5 to 10.0 mm, a magnitude that would challenge the safety resection margin typically tolerated for tractography-informed surgical guidance. This was particularly relevant for tracts oriented partially or fully in-line with the acquired diffusion phase-encoded direction. Portions of these tracts passing close to the resection site demonstrated significantly greater magnitude of displacement, compared to portions of tracts remote from the resection site in the operative hemisphere. Our findings have direct clinical implication on the accuracy of intraoperative tractography-informed image guidance and emphasize the need to develop a distortion correction technique with feasible intraoperative processing time.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperatively acquired diffusion tensor image (DTI) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) have been proved to be effective in providing more anatomical and functional information; however, the brain deformation induced by brain shift and tumor resection severely impairs the correspondence between the image space and the patient space in image-guided neurosurgery. METHOD: To address the brain deformation, we developed a hybrid non-rigid registration method to register high-field preoperative MRI with low-field intra-operative MRI in order to recover the deformation induced by brain shift and tumor resection. The registered DTI and BOLD are fused with low-field intra-operative MRI for image-guided neurosurgery. RESULTS: The proposed hybrid registration method was evaluated by comparing the landmarks predicted by the hybrid registration method with the landmarks identified in the low-field intra-operative MRI for 10 patients. The prediction error of the hybrid method is 1.92±0.54 mm, and the compensation accuracy is 74.3±5.0\%. Compared to the landmarks far from the resection region, those near the resection region demonstrated a higher compensation accuracy (P-value=.003) although these landmarks had larger initial displacements. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed hybrid registration method is able to bring preoperatively acquired BOLD and DTI into the operating room and compensate for the deformation to augment low-field intra-operative MRI with rich anatomical and functional information.

  abstract = {In contrast to the more common Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) allows superior delineation of angular microstructures of brain white matter, and makes possible multiple-fiber modeling of each voxel for better characterization of brain connectivity. However, the complex orientation information afforded by HARDI makes registration of HARDI images more complicated than scalar images. In particular, the question of how much orientation information is needed for satisfactory alignment has not been sufficiently addressed. Low order orientation representation is generally more robust than high order representation, although the latter provides more information for correct alignment of fiber pathways. However, high order representation, when naïvely utilized, might not necessarily be conducive to improving registration accuracy since similar structures with significant orientation differences prior to proper alignment might be mistakenly taken as non-matching structures. We present in this paper a HARDI registration algorithm, called SPherical Harmonic Elastic REgistration (SPHERE), which in a principled means hierarchically extracts orientation information from HARDI data for structural alignment. The image volumes are first registered using robust, relatively direction invariant features derived from the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF), and the alignment is then further refined using spherical harmonic (SH) representation with gradually increasing orders. This progression from non-directional, single-directional to multi-directional representation provides a systematic means of extracting directional information given by diffusion-weighted imaging. Coupled with a template-subject-consistent soft-correspondence-matching scheme, this approach allows robust and accurate alignment of HARDI data. Experimental results show marked increase in accuracy over a state-of-the-art DTI registration algorithm. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI tractography has emerged as a useful and popular tool for mapping connections between brain regions. In this study, we examined the performance of quantitative anisotropy (QA) in facilitating deterministic fiber tracking. Two phantom studies were conducted. The first phantom study examined the susceptibility of fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized factional anisotropy (GFA), and QA to various partial volume effects. The second phantom study examined the spatial resolution of the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and QA-aided tractographies. An in vivo study was conducted to track the arcuate fasciculus, and two neurosurgeons blind to the acquisition and analysis settings were invited to identify false tracks. The performance of QA in assisting fiber tracking was compared with FA, GFA, and anatomical information from T1-weighted images. Our first phantom study showed that QA is less sensitive to the partial volume effects of crossing fibers and free water, suggesting that it is a robust index. The second phantom study showed that the QA-aided tractography has better resolution than the FA-aided and GFA-aided tractography. Our in vivo study further showed that the QA-aided tractography outperforms the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies. In the shell scheme (HARDI), the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 30.7\%, 32.6\%, and 24.45\% of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided tractography has 16.2\%. In the grid scheme (DSI), the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 12.3\%, 9.0\%, and 10.93\% of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided tractography has 4.43\%. The QA-aided deterministic fiber tracking may assist fiber tracking studies and facilitate the advancement of human connectomics.},

The Human Connectome Project ushered in an era of impressive advances in dMRI acquisition and analysis. As a result of these efforts, the quality of dMRI data that could be acquired in vivo improved substantially, and large collections of such data became widely available. Despite this progress, the main limitation of dMRI remains: it does not image axons directly, but only provides indirect measurements based on the diffusion of water molecules. Thus, it must be validated by methods that allow direct visualization of axons but that can only be performed in post mortem brain tissue. In this review, we discuss methods for validating the various features of connectional anatomy that are extracted from dMRI, both at the macro-scale (trajectories of axon bundles), and at micro-scale (axonal orientations and other microstructural properties). We present a range of validation tools, including anatomic tracer studies, Klingler's dissection, myelin stains, label-free optical imaging techniques, and others.

  abstract = {Anterior temporal lobe resection is often complicated by superior quadrantic visual field deficits (VFDs). In some cases this can be severe enough to prohibit driving, even if a patient is free of seizures. These deficits are caused by damage to Meyers loop of the optic radiation, which shows considerable heterogeneity in its anterior extent. This structure cannot be distinguished using clinical magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Diffusion tensor tractography is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables the parcellation of white matter. Using seed voxels antero-lateral to the lateral geniculate nucleus, we applied this technique to 20 control subjects, and 21 postoperative patients. All patients had visual fields assessed with Goldmann perimetry at least three months after surgery. We measured the distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal pole and horn in all subjects. In addition, we measured the size of temporal lobe resection using postoperative T1-weighted images, and quantified VFDs. Nine patients suffered VFDs ranging from 22 to 87 of the contralateral superior quadrant. In patients, the range of distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal pole was 2443 mm (mean 34 mm), and the range of distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal horn was -15 to 9 mm (mean 0 mm). In controls the range of distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal pole was 2447 mm (mean 35 mm), and the range of distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal horn was -11 to 9 mm (mean 0 mm). Both quantitative and qualitative results were in accord with recent dissections of cadaveric brains, and analysis of postoperative VFDs and resection volumes. By applying a linear regression analysis we showed that both distance from the tip of Meyers loop to the temporal pole and the size of resection were significant predictors of the postoperative VFDs. We conclude that there is considerable variation in the anterior extent of Meyers loop. In view of this, diffusion tensor tractography of the optic radiation is a potentially useful method to assess an individual patients risk of postoperative VFDs following anterior temporal lobe resection.},

For each example subject, an atlas is maintained to allow the example data of a subject to be added or deleted flexibly. A voting scheme is proposed to facilitate the multi-atlas exploitation of example data. For conceptual simplicity, we adopt the same metrics in both example data construction and WM tract labeling. Due to the huge number of WM tracts in a subject, it is time-consuming to label each WM tract individually. Thus, the WM tracts are grouped according to their shape similarity, and WM tracts within each group are labeled simultaneously. To further enhance the computational efficiency, we implemented our approach on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Through nested cross-validation we demonstrated that our approach yielded high classification performance. The average sensitivities for bundles in the left and right hemispheres were 89.5\% and 91.0\%, respectively, and their average false discovery rates were 14.9\% and 14.2\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Purpose:: Intraoperative diffusion MRI could provide a means of visualising brain fibre tracts near a neurosurgical target after preoperative images have been invalidated by brain shift. We propose an atlas-based intraoperative tract segmentation method, as the standard preoperative method, streamline tractography, is unsuitable for intraoperative implementation. Methods:: A tract-specific voxel-wise fibre orientation atlas is constructed from healthy training data. After registration with a target image, a radial tumour deformation model is applied to the orientation atlas to account for displacement caused by lesions. The final tract map is obtained from the inner product of the atlas and target image fibre orientation data derived from intraoperative diffusion MRI. Results:: The simple tumour model takes only seconds to effectively deform the atlas into alignment with the target image. With minimal processing time and operator effort, maps of surgically relevant tracts can be achieved that are visually and qualitatively comparable with results obtained from streamline tractography. Conclusion:: Preliminary results demonstrate feasibility of intraoperative streamline-free tract segmentation in challenging neurosurgical cases. Demonstrated results in a small number of representative sample subjects are realistic despite the simplicity of the tumour deformation model employed. Following this proof of concept, future studies will focus on achieving robustness in a wide range of tumour types and clinical scenarios, as well as quantitative validation of segmentations.},

Methods Sixty consecutive right-handed patients with PD with and without visual hallucinations were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Diffusion tensor imaging was acquired by 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging. We measured fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of the bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus using diffusion tensor tractography analysis software. Results Seventeen patients with PD had visual hallucinations; these patients tended to have lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity values in all fasciculi than did patients without visual hallucinations. A univariate logistic analysis showed that the presence of visual hallucinations was significantly associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. A multivariable logistic analysis adjusted by MMSE scores and disease duration showed a significant association between the presence of visual hallucinations and fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusions Our results suggest that disruption of left inferior longitudinal fasciculus integrity is associated with visual hallucinations in patients with PD, independent of cognitive impairment and disease duration.},

  abstract = {A deformable registration method is proposed for registering a normal brain atlas with images of brain tumor patients. The registration is facilitated by first simulating the tumor mass effect in the normal atlas in order to create an atlas image that is as similar as possible to the patient's image. An optimization framework is used to optimize the location of tumor seed as well as other parameters of the tumor growth model, based on the pattern of deformation around the tumor region. In particular, the optimization is implemented in a multiresolution and hierarchical scheme, and it is accelerated by using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based model of tumor growth and mass effect, trained on a computationally more expensive biomechanical model. Validation on simulated and real images shows that the proposed registration framework, referred to as ORBIT (optimization of tumor parameters and registration of brain images with tumors), outperforms other available registration methods particularly for the regions close to the tumor, and it has the potential to assist in constructing statistical atlases from tumor-diseased brain images. © 2008 IEEE.},

In this paper, we evaluate the impact that different biomechanical simulators have on the accuracy of deformable registration. We use two alternative frameworks for biomechanical simulations of mass effect in 3-D magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The first one is based on a finite-element model of nonlinear elasticity and unstructured meshes using the commercial software package ABAQUS. The second one employs incremental linear elasticity and regular grids in a fictitious domain method. In practice, biomechanical simulations via the second approach may be at least ten times faster. Landmarks error and visual examination of the coregistered images indicate that the two alternative frameworks for biomechanical simulations lead to comparable results of deformable registration. Thus, the computationally less expensive biomechanical simulator offers a practical alternative for registration purposes. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Although a variety of diffeomorphic deformable registration methods exist in the literature, application of these methods in the presence of space-occupying lesions is not straightforward. The motivation of this work is spatial normalization of MR images from patients with brain tumors in a common stereotaxic space, aiming to pool data from different patients into a common space in order to perform group analyses. Additionally, transfer of structural and functional information from neuroanatomical brain atlases into the individual patient's space can be achieved via the inverse mapping, for the purpose of segmenting brains and facilitating surgical or radiotherapy treatment planning. A method that estimates the brain tissue loss and replacement by tumor is applied for achieving equivalent image content between an atlas and a patient's scan, based on a biomechanical model of tumor growth. Automated estimation of the parameters modeling brain tissue loss and displacement is performed via optimization of an objective function reflecting feature-based similarity and elastic stretching energy, which is optimized in parallel via APPSPACK (Asynchronous Parallel Pattern Search). The results of the method, applied to 21 brain tumor patients, indicate that the registration accuracy is relatively high in areas around the tumor, as well as in the healthy portion of the brain. Also, the calculated deformation in the vicinity of the tumor is shown to correlate highly with expert-defined visual scores indicating the tumor mass effect, thereby potentially leading to an objective approach to quantification of mass effect, which is commonly used in diagnosis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Surgery in and around eloquent brain structures poses a technical challenge when the goal of surgery is maximal safe resection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, but tractography still remains limited in terms of utility because of the requisite manual labor and time required combined with the high risk of bias and inaccuracy. Automated whole brain tractography (AWBT) has simplified this workflow, overcoming historical barriers, and allowing for integration into modern neuronavigation. However, current literature showing the usefulness of this new technology is limited.~In this study, we aimed to illustrate the utility of AWBT during cranial surgery and its ability to affect presurgical and intraoperative clinical decision making.~We performed a retrospective chart review of cases that underwent AWBT for one year from July 2016 to July 2017. All patients underwent conventional anatomic MRI with and without contrast sequences, in addition to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner~(Ingenia 3.0T, Philips, Amsterdam NL). Post-hoc AWBT processing was performed on a separate workstation. Patients were subsequently grouped into those that had undergone either language or motor mapping and those that did not. We compared both sets of patients to see any differences in patient age, sex, laterality of surgery, depth of resection from cortical surface, and smallest distance between the lesion and adjacent eloquent white matter tracts. We identified illustrative cases which demonstrated the ability of AWBT to affect surgical decision making.~In this single-center series, we identified 73 total patients who underwent AWBT for intracranial surgery, of which 28 patients underwent either speech or language mapping. When comparing mapping to non-mapping patients, we found no difference with respect to age, gender, laterality of surgery, or whether the surgery was a revision. The distance between the lesion and eloquent white matter tracts demonstrated a statistically significant difference between mapping and non-mapping patients, namely in the corticospinal tract (p {$<$} 0.0001), the superior longitudinal fasciculus (p {$<$} 0.0001), and the arcuate fasciculus (p {$<$} 0.004). Patients who underwent mapping were at equal risk for having a postoperative deficit (p = 0.772) but had an improved chance of recovery (p = 0.041) after surgery. We believe this phenomenon is related to increased awareness and avoidance of functional tissue during surgery, which occurs due to the combination of preoperatively identifying white matter tracts with AWBT and intraoperatively testing margins with mapping. We provide two illustrative cases that show the impact of AWBT on patient outcomes. In conclusion,~AWBT is relatively simple to perform and provides vital information for surgeons about eloquent white matter tracts that can be used to help improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Gliomas are the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors due to their infiltrative nature and rapid progression. The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore, this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture, namely DeepSeg, for fully automated detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data. Methods: The developed DeepSeg is a modular decoupling framework. It consists of two connected core parts based on an encoding and decoding relationship. The encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for spatial information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder part to get the full-resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net architecture, different CNN models such as residual neural network (ResNet), dense convolutional network (DenseNet), and NASNet have been utilized in this study. Results: The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019) challenge, including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance scores of obtained segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly. Conclusion: This study showed successful feasibility and comparative performance of applying different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg framework for automated brain tumor segmentation in FLAIR MR images.

  abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30. min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10. min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {In the dual-route language model, the dorsal pathway is known for sound-to-motor mapping, but the role of the ventral stream is controversial. With the goal of enhancing our understanding of language models, this study investigated the diffusion characteristics of candidate tracts in aphasic patients. We evaluated 14 subacute aphasic patients post-stroke and 11 healthy controls with language assessment and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping found multiple linguistic associations for the ventral stream, while automated fiber quantification (AFQ) showed, via reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity with increased radial diffusivity (all corrected p\,{$<$}\,0.05), that the integrity of both the left dorsal and ventral streams was compromised. The average diffusion metrics of each fascicle provided by AFQ also confirmed that voxels with significant FA-language correlations were located in the ventral tracts, including the left inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF) (comprehension: r\,=\,0.839, p\,=\,0.001; repetition: r\,=\,0.845, p\,=\,0.001; naming: r\,=\,0.813, p\,=\,0.002; aphasia quotient: r\,=\,0.847, p\,=\,0.001) and uncinate fascicle (naming: r\,=\,0.948, p\,=\,0.001). Furthermore, point-wise AFQ revealed that the segment of the left IFOF with the strongest correlations was its narrow stem. The temporal segment of the left inferior longitudinal fascicle was also found to correlate significantly with comprehension (r\,=\,0.663, p\,=\,0.03) and repetition (r\,=\,0.742, p\,=\,0.009). This preliminary study suggests that white matter integrity analysis of the ventral stream may have the potential to reveal aphasic severity and guide individualized rehabilitation. The left IFOF, specifically its narrow stem segment, associates with multiple aspects of language, indicating an important role in semantic processing and multimodal linguistic functions.},

We create a large-scale training tractography dataset of 1 million labeled fiber samples (54 anatomical tracts are included). To discriminate between fibers from different tracts, we propose a novel 2D multi-channel feature descriptor (FiberMap) that encodes spatial coordinates of points along each fiber. We learn a CNN tract classification model based on FiberMap and obtain a high tract classification accuracy of 90.99\%. The method is evaluated on a test dataset of 374 dMRI scans from three independently acquired populations across health conditions (healthy control, neuropsychiatric disorders, and brain tumor patients). We perform comparisons with two state-of-the-art white matter tract segmentation methods. Experimental results show that our method obtains a highly consistent segmentation result, where over 99\% of the fiber tracts are successfully detected across all subjects under study, most importantly, including patients with space occupying brain tumors. The proposed method leverages deep learning techniques and provides a much faster and more efficient tool for large data analysis than methods using traditional machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We present SlicerDMRI, an open-source software suite that enables research using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), the only modality that can map the white matter connections of the living human brain. SlicerDMRI enables analysis and visualization of dMRI data and is aimed at the needs of clinical research users. SlicerDMRI is built upon and deeply integrated with 3D Slicer, a National Institutes of Health-supported open-source platform for medical image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional visualization. Integration with 3D Slicer provides many features of interest to cancer researchers, such as real-time integration with neuronavigation equipment, intraoperative imaging modalities, and multimodal data fusion. One key application of SlicerDMRI is in neurosurgery research, where brain mapping using dMRI can provide patient-specific maps of critical brain connections as well as insight into the tissue microstructure that surrounds brain tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this article, we focus on a demonstration of SlicerDMRI as an informatics tool to enable end-to-end dMRI analyses in two retrospective imaging data sets from patients with high-grade glioma. Analyses demonstrated here include conventional diffusion tensor analysis, advanced multifiber tractography, automated identification of critical fiber tracts, and integration of multimodal imagery with dMRI. RESULTS: We illustrate the ability of SlicerDMRI to perform both conventional and advanced dMRI analyses as well as to enable multimodal image analysis and visualization. We provide an overview of the clinical rationale for each analysis along with pointers to the SlicerDMRI tools used in each. CONCLUSION: SlicerDMRI provides open-source and clinician-accessible research software tools for dMRI analysis. SlicerDMRI is available for easy automated installation through the 3D Slicer Extension Manager.}

  abstract = {The comprehension of spoken language is one of the most essential language functions in humans. However, the neurological underpinnings of auditory comprehension remain under debate. Here we used multi-modal neuroimaging analyses on a group of patients with low-grade gliomas to localize cortical regions and white matter tracts responsible for auditory language comprehension. Region-of-interests and voxel-level whole-brain analyses showed that cortical areas in the posterior temporal lobe are crucial for language comprehension. The fiber integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging of the arcuate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus was strongly correlated with both auditory comprehension and the grey matter volume of the inferior temporal and middle temporal gyri. Together, our findings provide direct evidence for an integrated network of auditory comprehension whereby the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, the posterior parts of the middle and inferior temporal gyri serve as auditory comprehension cortex, and the arcuate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus subserve as crucial structural connectivity. These findings provide critical evidence on the neural underpinnings of language comprehension.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the time-dependent diffusivity at short diffusion times, as measured by oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion MRI, can characterize tissue microstructures in glioma patients. THEORY AND METHODS: Five adult patients with known diffuse glioma, including two pre-surgical and three with new enhancing lesions after treatment for high-grade glioma, were scanned in an ultra-high-performance gradient 3.0T MRI system. OGSE diffusion MRI at 30-100\,Hz and pulsed gradient spin echo diffusion imaging (approximated as 0\,Hz) were obtained. The ADC and trace-diffusion-weighted image at each acquired frequency were calculated, that is, ADC (f) and TraceDWI (f). RESULTS: In pre-surgical patients, biopsy-confirmed solid enhancing tumor in a high-grade glioblastoma showed higher    ADC  ( f )  ADC  ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} (f)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  and lower    TraceDWI  ( f )  TraceDWI  ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash{} (f)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  , compared to that at same OGSE frequency in a low-grade astrocytoma. In post-treatment patients, the enhancing lesions of two patients who were diagnosed with tumor progression contained more voxels with high    ADC  ( f )  ADC  ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} (f)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  and low    TraceDWI ( f )  TraceDWI ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash mathrm\{f\}\textbackslash right)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  , compared to the enhancing lesions of a patient who was diagnosed with treatment effect. Non-enhancing T2 signal abnormality lesions in both the pre-surgical high-grade glioblastoma and post-treatment tumor progressions showed regions with high    ADC  ( f )  ADC  ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} (f)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ADC\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  and low    TraceDWI  ( f )  TraceDWI  ( 0  Hz )    \$\$ \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(\textbackslash mathrm\{f\}\textbackslash right)\}\{\textbackslash mathrm\{TraceDWI\}\textbackslash{} \textbackslash left(0\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mathrm\{Hz\}\textbackslash right)\} \$\$  , consistent with infiltrative tumor. The solid tumor of the glioblastoma, the enhancing lesions of post-treatment tumor progressions, and the suspected infiltrative tumors showed high diffusion time-dependency from 30 to 100\,Hz, consistent with high intra-tumoral volume fraction (cellular density). CONCLUSION: Different characteristics of OGSE-based time-dependent diffusivity can reveal heterogenous tissue microstructures that indicate cellular density in glioma patients.},

  abstract = {While the diagnosis of high-grade glioma (HGG) is still associated with a considerably poor prognosis, neurosurgical tumor resection provides an opportunity for prolonged survival and improved quality of life for affected patients. However, successful tumor resection is dependent on a proper surgical planning to avoid surgery-induced functional deficits whilst achieving a maximum extent of resection (EOR). With diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) providing insight into individual white matter neuroanatomy, the challenge remains to disentangle that information as correctly and as completely as possible. In particular, due to the lack of sensitivity and accuracy, the clinical value of widely used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based tractography is increasingly questioned. We evaluated whether the recently developed multi-level fiber tracking (MLFT) technique can improve tractography of the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with motor-eloquent HGGs. Forty patients with therapy-naïve HGGs (mean age: 62.6 ± 13.4 years, 57.5\% males) and preoperative diffusion MRI [repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE): 5000/78 ms, voxel size: 2x2x2 mm3, one volume at b=0 s/mm2, 32 volumes at b=1000 s/mm2] underwent reconstruction of the CST of the tumor-affected and unaffected hemispheres using MLFT in addition to deterministic DTI-based and deterministic constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based fiber tractography. The brain stem was used as a seeding region, with a motor cortex mask serving as a target region for MLFT and a region of interest (ROI) for the other two algorithms. Application of the MLFT method substantially improved bundle reconstruction, leading to CST bundles with higher radial extent compared to the two other algorithms (delineation of CST fanning with a wider range; median radial extent for tumor-affected vs. unaffected hemisphere – DTI: 19.46° vs. 18.99°, p=0.8931; CSD: 30.54° vs. 27.63°, p=0.0546; MLFT: 81.17° vs. 74.59°, p=0.0134). In addition, reconstructions by MLFT and CSD-based tractography nearly completely included respective bundles derived from DTI-based tractography, which was however favorable for MLFT compared to CSD-based tractography (median coverage of the DTI-based CST for affected vs. unaffected hemispheres – CSD: 68.16\% vs. 77.59\%, p=0.0075; MLFT: 93.09\% vs. 95.49\%; p=0.0046). Thus, a more complete picture of the CST in patients with motor-eloquent HGGs might be achieved based on routinely acquired diffusion MRI data using MLFT.},

  abstract = {The validity of brain tumour segmentation is an important issue in image processing because it has a direct impact on surgical planning. We examined the segmentation accuracy based on three two-sample validation metrics against the estimated composite latent gold standard, which was derived from several experts' manual segmentations by an EM algorithm. The distribution functions of the tumour and control pixel data were parametrically assumed to be a mixture of two beta distributions with different shape parameters. We estimated the corresponding receiver operating characteristic curve, Dice similarity coefficient, and mutual information, over all possible decision thresholds. Based on each validation metric, an optimal threshold was then computed via maximization. We illustrated these methods on MR imaging data from nine brain tumour cases of three different tumour types, each consisting of a large number of pixels. The automated segmentation yielded satisfactory accuracy with varied optimal thresholds. The performances of these validation metrics were also investigated via Monte Carlo simulation. Extensions of incorporating spatial correlation structures using a Markov random field model were considered.},
