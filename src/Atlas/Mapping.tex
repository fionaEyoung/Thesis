\section{Tract mapping}
\label{chapterlabel4}

\note{This part is about the inner product, plus any other comparison between atlas and data, including e.g. KL divergence, fixel anaylsis...}

The methodological description has been, up to this point, concerned with capturing
prior information about tracts and bringing those priors into alignment with the target anatomy.
Finally, it remains to compare those priors with the information present in the target diffusion data itself.
