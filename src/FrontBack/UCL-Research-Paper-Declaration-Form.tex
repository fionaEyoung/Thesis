%	Self-plagiarism declaration form template for these typeset in LaTeX
%	Prepared by David Sheard 2022 and made available free of copyright

%	If you use the results of your own published, accepted or submitted data (text or figures) in your final
%	doctoral thesis, you have to give a clear indication of the previous work, stating the exact source of the
%	previous material, irrespective of whether copyright is owned by you or by a publisher. This indication
%	should take the form of
%		a) an appropriate citation of the original source in the relevant Chapter; and
%		b) completion of the UCL Research Paper Declaration form---this should be embedded after the
%		Acknowledgements page in the thesis.

%	For more information consult the following links:
%	\url{https://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/guidance-on-selfplagiarism/?utm_source=Students\%27+Union+UCL\&utm_campaign=2ed9e73ab7-\&utm_medium=email\&utm_term=0_fe8c0cbcf2-2ed9e73ab7-209240456\&mc_cid=2ed9e73ab7\&mc_eid=0496c22bfc}
%	\url{https://www.grad.ucl.ac.uk/essinfo/guidance-on-selfplagiarism/Declaration-form_published-work-in-thesis.docx}

%	I recommend using this template by simply copying everything between \begin{document} and \end{document}
%	into your thesis after the acknowledgements section. By changing the preamble appropriately this template
%	may also be altered to work using \input{...} or the subfiles package.

\section*{UCL Research Paper Declaration Form: referencing the doctoral candidate’s own published work(s)}
% Uncomment the following line if you would like to add this declaration to your table of contents
% \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{UCL Research Paper Declaration Form}
%
% Please use this form to declare if parts of your thesis are already available in another format,
% e.g. if data, text, or figures:
% •	have been uploaded to a preprint server
% •	are in submission to a peer-reviewed publication
% •	have been published in a peer-reviewed publication, e.g. journal, textbook.
%
% This form should be completed as many times as necessary. For instance, if a student had seven
% thesis chapters, two of which having material which had been published, they would complete this form twice.
