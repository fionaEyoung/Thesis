Mapping and understanding the brain's structure and function is never more critical than when it suffers injury or illness.
Lifesaving neurosurgical procedures may put critical neural communication pathways called \gls{wm} tracts at risk, with grave consequences for the patient, so accurately depicting their location using \gls{dmri} is becoming a key component of modern neurosurgical practice.
More recently, obtaining new \gls{imri} partway through surgery has demonstrated potential to further improve outcomes by providing updated anatomical information after the dynamic effects of intraoperative brain shift have diminished the accuracy of preoperative imaging.
With the ability to sample directional water diffusivity in tissue, \gls{dmri} data is processed to produce millimetre-scale maps of \gls{wm} fibre orientations which are key to reconstructing individual tracts.
However, established image computational methods suffer from limitations in accuracy and practicality which restrict the wider clinical uptake of \gls{dmri} \gls{wm} imaging generally, and particularly for \gls{imri}.
After an in depth review of the state of the art in \gls{wm} imaging and image-guided neurosurgery, this thesis explores the development of a novel \gls{wm} tract mapping tool, named \textit{tractfinder}, which applies \textit{a priori} anatomical knowledge encoded within a statistical tract orientation and location atlas to achieve rapid tract segmentation in a patient \gls{dmri} scan.
The proposed pipeline includes explicit patient-specific modelling of tumour deformation effects, an element missing from many research-oriented tract reconstruction approaches.
Tractfinder's effectiveness in a range of applications is detailed through thorough quantitative evaluation, while clinical case studies demonstrate its key advantages over existing approaches.
In additional, the technical and practical challenges of intraoperative imaging are explored together with their implications for effective clinical translation of advanced \gls{dmri}-based \gls{wm} imaging.

This thesis explores the use of \gls{dmri}'s ability to map brain fibre pathways (``tracts") in neurosurgical planning and guidance, in in particular the potential for more advanced \gls{dmri} analysis methods than those currently under routine clinical use to improve outcomes for neurological patients.

Though intraoperative \gls{mri} has gradually been recognised as a beneficial technology for improving neurosurgery, the use of high angular resolution \gls{dmri} specifically has not been widely adopted, partly because the associated potential benefits have yet to be determined.
The methods described in this thesis may make \gls{dmri} analysis more accessible to intraoperative \gls{mri} procedures, which would allow their advantages to be systematically studied.
Over the longer term, intraoperative \gls{dmri} may, if found to be beneficial, be incorporated into national healthcare guidelines, as preoperative \gls{dti} and general \gls{mri} currently are.
In addition, the proposal of an alternative to streamline tractography, the current standard for \gls{wm} tract imaging, which relies less on the availability of domain experts, time, and computational resources, could widen the availability of tract imaging for preoperative planning to more health centres, who may have the requisite equipment (\gls{mri} capabilities) but lack expertise in applying modern research methods.

The tract orientation atlas framework put forth here could inform to the study of \gls{wm} architecture and connectivity in individuals and across populations, an area in which we are still lacking a lot of understanding, and which will be critical in the future study and combatting of psychological and neurological disorders.
It also contributes to current discussions on how to adopt modern data science methods and innovation in a field, medical imaging, where appropriate data is often scarce and difficult to annotate.
Brain shift is an intraoperative phenomenon which presents a key challenge to image guided surgery techniques.
The tumour deformation modelling described in this thesis represents a novel solution to achieving acceptable \gls{wm} tract segmentations on both pre- and intraoperative imaging, in patients with deforming tumours, which may be applicable to other imaging modalities as well as to tumours outside of the brain.

Findings presented in this thesis have been shared with the wider research community at several international meetings, and have led to funding being granted for a two year follow-on prospective study to apply these methods in intraoperative cases at \gls{gosh}, London.
All image processing tools developed for this thesis, including data and code for tumour deformation modelling and tract segmentation, have been made available for researchers to apply in their own data.
In addition, a patent application covering much of the methodology has been submitted and is currently under examination.
If granted, the intellectual property could be licensed to national or international commercial producers of neuronavigational equipment.
